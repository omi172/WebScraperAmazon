Dabur Honey - 1kg | 100% Pure | World's No.1 Honey Brand with No Sugar Adulteration,5.0 out of 5 stars,As someone who has always been captivated by the wonders of natural skincare, I can't help but sing the praises of honey. This golden elixir, straight from the beehive, has become a staple in my beauty routine, and for good reason.

Honey is a true multi-tasker when it comes to skincare. Packed with a wealth of nutrients and antioxidants, it offers a myriad of benefits that can transform the health and appearance of our skin.

One of the standout qualities of honey is its innate ability to deeply hydrate and nourish the skin. The natural sugars in honey act as humectants, drawing moisture into the skin and locking it in, leaving it soft, supple, and radiant. This makes honey an invaluable ingredient for those with dry or dehydrated skin, as it can replenish and rejuvenate the complexion.

But the magic of honey doesn't stop there. It also possesses powerful antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, thanks to its unique enzyme and phytochemical composition. This makes it a godsend for those struggling with acne-prone or blemish-prone skin. When applied topically, honey can help to soothe inflammation, reduce the appearance of breakouts, and even prevent future flare-ups.

Another captivating aspect of honey is its ability to gently exfoliate the skin. The natural enzymes in this natural wonder work to break down the bonds between dead skin cells, allowing them to be effortlessly swept away. This results in a brighter, more even-toned complexion, with a radiant, youthful glow.

I've personally found that incorporating honey into my skincare routine has been a game-changer. Whether I'm using it as a nourishing face mask, a soothing spot treatment, or even as a natural makeup remover, the results are always the same – my skin feels refreshed, rejuvenated, and bursting with a healthy, luminous glow.

What I love most about honey is its versatility. As a natural, unprocessed ingredient, it can be seamlessly incorporated into a wide range of DIY skincare concoctions, allowing you to tailor your regimen to your specific skin needs. From honey-infused face scrubs to honey-based moisturizers, the possibilities are endless.
Read more,Olive Oil: The Liquid Gold for Health and Radiant Skin As a health-conscious consumer, I've always been a firm believer in the power of extra virgin olive oil. This liquid gold not only enhances the flavor of my culinary creations but also serves as a versatile ingredient that offers a plethora of benefits for my overall well-being and skin. Firstly, it's important to note that not all olive oils are created equal. The true stars are the extra virgin varieties, which are the result of the first cold-pressing of the olives. This process ensures that the oil retains its natural nutrients, antioxidants, and robust flavor profile. I always make sure to look for the "extra virgin" label when shopping, as this is a hallmark of the highest quality. When it comes to health benefits, olive oil is a true powerhouse. Rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, it helps to lower harmful LDL cholesterol levels while simultaneously boosting the levels of beneficial HDL cholesterol. This delicate balance contributes to a healthier cardiovascular system and reduced risk of heart disease. Additionally, the antioxidant-rich components of extra virgin olive oil, such as polyphenols, have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties, making it a valuable ally in the fight against chronic conditions. But the benefits of olive oil extend far beyond internal well-being – it's also a skincare marvel. The same nourishing fatty acids that benefit our bodies also work wonders for the skin. When applied topically, olive oil helps to deeply hydrate and nourish the skin, leaving it soft, supple, and radiant. Its ability to lock in moisture, coupled with its anti-aging properties, makes it an invaluable addition to any skincare routine. Moreover, the vitamin E and A found in extra virgin olive oil can help to soothe inflammation, reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and even aid in the healing of minor cuts and scrapes. I love incorporating it into my DIY face masks and body treatments for a luxurious, spa-like experience.

Fortune Premium Kachi Ghani Pure Mustard Oil, 1 ltr pouch,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fortune Premium Kachi Ghani Pure Mustard Oil promises an authentic taste experience with its cold-pressed method. But does it deliver a culinary knockout, or is it a flavor foul? Let's break down the taste, aroma, and performance of this oil.

Pros:

Rich, Pungent Aroma: Fans of mustard oil will appreciate the robust, pungent aroma this oil brings to the table. It adds a distinct character to curries, tadkas (seasoning splutters), and marinades.
Strong Mustard Flavor: The cold-pressed method reportedly preserves the natural mustardy taste, which can elevate dishes like dals (lentil curries) and stir-fries.
High Smoke Point: As a cold-pressed oil, Fortune Premium Kachi Ghani boasts a relatively high smoke point, making it suitable for some stir-frying and sauteing applications.
Health Benefits (claimed): Fortune's marketing mentions being rich in Omega 3 & 6 and Vitamins A, E & Beta Carotene. However, it's always wise to consult a doctor for dietary advice.
Cons:

Overpowering for Some: The strong mustard flavor might be too overpowering for those not accustomed to it. Consider using it sparingly or blending it with neutral oils for a milder taste.
Limited Cooking Applications: Due to its strong flavor, this oil might not be suitable for all dishes. It might overpower delicate flavors in some recipes.
Price: Cold-pressed oils often come at a premium price point. Fortune Premium Kachi Ghani is no exception, so factor in the cost before buying.
Overall:

Fortune Premium Kachi Ghani Pure Mustard Oil is a niche product catering to those who love the bold taste of mustard oil. Its strong aroma and flavor can add depth and complexity to curries, tadkas, and specific stir-fries. However, its potency might not be for everyone, and its higher price tag warrants consideration.

Recommendation:

If you're a fan of robust mustard oil flavors and want to elevate your curries and tadkas, Fortune Premium Kachi Ghani is a great choice. However, if you prefer milder oils or are new to mustard oil, it might be best to start with a smaller quantity or explore other Fortune options.

I appreciate the versatility of these cashews. They make for a delightful snack on their own, whether enjoyed straight out of the bag or mixed with other nuts and dried fruits for a homemade trail mix. Additionally, they add a delightful crunch and richness to both sweet and savory dishes, from salads to stir-fries and desserts.

In terms of value for money, the 500g pack offers great value compared to other brands in the market. The quantity provided is ample, making it suitable for both personal snacking and culinary use.

While I thoroughly enjoy the Amazon Brand - Vedaka Whole Cashews, I must note that occasionally, I come across a few broken pieces in the pack. However, this is a minor inconvenience considering the overall quality and taste of the product.

Tata Sampann Masoor Dal, Whole, 1kg,3.0 out of 5 stars, 👎🏿The grains are too big. There is small grain variety of whole masoor dal which is more prefferable. The small grain dal is always more expensive than large grain dal but in local kirana stores small grain whole masoor is priced cheaper than this tata large grain whole masoor that's pathetic. We wanted small grain whole masoor. You can see the pictures, the difference in size of grains is just too big.⚠️
👍This is unpolished dal and has fresh, natural aroma of raw dal.
👍Since unpolished it has retained many nutrients which would otherwise have been lost during polishing.
👍Thus unpolished dal is healthy and is rich in protein.
👍This is a whole variant. The time taken to get boiled and cooked properly is OK, doesn't take long to cook.
👍Once cooked the taste and aroma is great of this dal and is better than the local kirana stores dal.
👍The masoor dal is freshly packed and delivered.
👍The packaging is first class. The product is sorted. No dust, no excessive powder, no foreign particles inside packet.
👎🏿Price is high and could have been a little less.

3. Rich in protein.
4. Anti-Ageing Properties- Masoor dal is a powerhouse of antioxidants which may effectively reduce the cell damage. Its abundant proportions of nutrients tend to boost the immune system
5. Nourishes Teeth and Bones- Masoor dal is a rich source of vitamins and other nutrients like calcium and magnesium, which are essential
6. Helpful In Maintaining A Healthy Vision-  Along with the above-mentioned nutritional values, masoor dal is also a rich source of vitamin A, C and E.

**Natural Sweetness with Health Benefits**

Dabur Honey is a best Alternative of sugar in my kitchen, and for good reason. Known for its commitment to quality and purity, Dabur has crafted a product that stands out in the crowded market of honey brands.

Taste and Texture:

Amazon Brand - Presto! Disinfectant Toilet Cleaner, Rose - 1 L (Pack Of 2)|Kills 99.9% Germs,3.0 out of 5 stars,Overall: 3 stars - This toilet cleaner gets the job done but has a few drawbacks.

Pros:

Effective Cleaning: Removes light stains and grime reasonably well.
Germ Killing: Kills 99.9% of germs according to the label, which is a plus for hygiene.
Value Pack: The double pack is economical, especially if you clean your toilets frequently.
Easy to Use: The bottle has a convenient nozzle for reaching under the rim and into corners.
Cons:

Limited Stain Removal: Struggles with tougher stains or heavy buildup. May require scrubbing for stubborn marks.
Light Scent: The rose fragrance is pleasant but fades quickly. Some users might prefer a stronger scent for lingering freshness.
Unknown Strength: The lack of specific information about the disinfecting ingredients makes it difficult to gauge its effectiveness against certain bacteria or viruses.
Recommendation:

This is an okay toilet cleaner for basic cleaning and germ reduction. It's a good option for those on a budget who don't mind a lighter fragrance. However, if you're dealing with tough stains or require a powerful disinfectant with a long-lasting scent, you might want to consider a different product.

Additional Notes:

Always wear gloves when using any toilet cleaner.
Ensure proper ventilation while using the product.
For tough stains, consider using a stronger cleaner or a toilet bowl ring to prevent future buildup.
I hope this review helps!

Tide Plus Double Power Detergent Washing Powder Jasmine & Rose 6kg + 2kg FREE,5.0 out of 5 stars,Overall: Great stain removal, cleans whites well, but scent might be too strong for some.

Cleaning Power: This detergent packs a punch! The "Stain Magnet" technology seems to work well, as I've had good results removing tough stains like grease and ketchup. It also brightens whites effectively.

Scent: The Jasmine & Rose scent is pleasant, but it is strong. If you're sensitive to scents, this might not be the best choice for you.

Value: The 6kg + 2kg FREE deal is a good value, especially if you have a large family or go through detergent quickly.

Other Considerations:

Suitable for both whites and colors.
Dissolves easily in water.
Creates good suds for a deep clean.
Can be used for handwashing or in semi-automatic washing machines.
Recommendation: I would recommend this detergent to people who are looking for a powerful stain remover that brightens whites. However, if you are sensitive to scents, you might want to try a different fragrance or brand.

Additional Notes:

I haven't experienced any issues with fading colors, but it's always a good idea to test on a small area of clothing first, especially for delicate fabrics.
Be mindful of using the correct amount of detergent - too much can leave residue on clothes.
I hope this review helps you decide if Tide Plus Double Power Detergent Jasmine & Rose is the right choice for you!

Whether you’re a seasoned cook or a novice in the kitchen, these chunks are incredibly easy to incorporate into your favorite recipes.

Furthermore, the packaging of Nutrela SOYA Chunks is convenient and keeps the product fresh for a long time. The 1 kg pack size is perfect for stocking up and ensures that I always have this nutritious ingredient on hand whenever I need it.

NRIP Anjeer Afghani (Dried Figs) 200 Gm,5.0 out of 5 stars,The figs are plump, moist, and have a rich, sweet flavor that makes them a delightful snack or a great addition to various dishes. They come well-packaged, ensuring the figs remain fresh and easy to store.

They are in consistent texture; they’re not too dry or overly chewy, striking a perfect balance. These figs also seem to be of premium quality, as there were no hard or unripe pieces in the package.
Additionally, the price is really very low due to sale, it’s worth it.

NRIP Anjeer Afghani (Dried Figs) 200 Gm,5.0 out of 5 stars,**Five-Star Review for Dried Figs:**

I recently tried these dried figs, and they are absolutely delicious! Each fig is perfectly sweet, with a rich, chewy texture that makes them an irresistible snack. The natural sweetness of the figs is complemented by a slight hint of caramel, making them a satisfying treat without being overly sugary.

I also love how versatile they are—whether I'm enjoying them on their own, adding them to a charcuterie board, or mixing them into my morning oatmeal, they always deliver a burst of flavor. Plus, they're packed with fiber and nutrients, making them a healthy choice that doesn't compromise on taste.

The packaging is also great, keeping the figs fresh and ensuring they stay soft and flavorful. If you're looking for a wholesome, delicious snack, these dried figs are a must-try. Highly recommended!,Shahrukh

As a busy individual, I appreciate products that offer convenience without compromising on effectiveness, and this detergent delivers on both fronts.

First and foremost, the detergent’s liquid form makes it incredibly easy to use. No more messy spills or measuring out precise amounts of powder - simply pour the desired amount into the washing machine’s dispenser, and you’re good to go. The 3.2 L refill pack is also convenient and cost-effective, providing ample detergent for multiple washes without the need for frequent replacements.

I also appreciate the detergent’s compatibility with top-load washing machines, as it is specifically formulated to work with their unique washing mechanisms. The low-foam formula ensures efficient cleaning without excessive suds, preventing damage to the machine and ensuring optimal wash results.

Furthermore, Surf Excel Matic Top Load Liquid Detergent is gentle on fabrics, making it suitable for use on a wide range of clothing materials, including cotton, synthetics, and delicate fabrics. It helps preserve the color and texture of garments wash after wash, ensuring they look and feel their best for longer.

DiSano Pure Honey 500 g (pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,Good in quality and price is also cheap.,JIbesh Chandra Kalita
DiSano Pure Honey 500 g (pack of 1),3.0 out of 5 stars,No one how a original honey taste's like.

I recently tried DiSano Not a Pure Honey 500g, and my experience was average. While the product claims to be honey, I found its taste and consistency to be somewhat lacking compared to other pure honey brands I've tried in the past. It lacks the rich flavor and thickness that I typically associate with high-quality honey.

On the positive side, the packaging is convenient and easy to use, with a sturdy bottle that prevents any leaks or spills. The size of the bottle is also sufficient for occasional use in cooking or as a sweetener for beverages.

However, I was disappointed by the lack of depth in flavor and the slightly watery texture of the honey. It seemed to lack the natural sweetness and complexity that I expect from pure honey.

Overall, while DiSano Not a Pure Honey may suffice for basic cooking or sweetening needs, I would recommend exploring other options if you're looking for a more authentic honey experience.

DiSano Pure Honey 500 g (pack of 1),1.0 out of 5 stars, I'm extremely disappointed with the product's quality.

After just one month of use, its texture has completely deteriorated, resembling fruit jam.

The honey has started crystallizing and leaving sugar deposits all over the bottle.

The taste has also changed dramatically, now overwhelmingly sweet like eating pure sugar. I've stored it in a normal room temperature kitchen, ruling out any climate-related issues.

I strongly suspect they're adding excessive sugar to the product.

Please refer to the attached video for evidence of its condition.

NutriOrganics Dry Fruits Premium Seedless Kishmish |Green Raisins Kismis |1kg pack,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely delighted with NutriOrganics Premium Seedless Kishmish! The quality is top-notch, and the taste is sublime. These succulent gems are bursting with sweetness and have a tender, chewy texture that's simply irresistible. I'm obsessed!,Nachiketa
NutriOrganics Dry Fruits Premium Seedless Kishmish |Green Raisins Kismis |1kg pack,4.0 out of 5 stars,I recently tried the NutriOrganics Dry Fruits Premium Seedless Kishmish, and here’s my experience with the product:

#### **Packaging:**
The packaging of the product is sturdy and airtight, which helps in keeping the raisins fresh for a longer period. The 1kg pack is convenient for families or those who use raisins frequently in their daily diet. The resealable pack ensures that the product stays fresh even after multiple uses.

#### **Quality:**
The quality of the raisins is impressive. Each raisin is of uniform size, and the green color is vibrant, indicating freshness. The raisins are clean and free from any debris, dirt, or sugar coating, which is often found in lower-quality products. They are also seedless, which is a big plus as it makes them easy to use in various recipes without any additional effort.

#### **Taste:**
These raisins have a naturally sweet taste, which is not overly sugary but rather a pleasant, natural sweetness. They have a soft and chewy texture, making them a delightful snack on their own or a perfect addition to dishes like oatmeal, salads, and desserts. The flavor is rich and complements both sweet and savory dishes.

#### **Nutritional Value:**
Raisins are a great source of energy and are packed with essential nutrients like fiber, vitamins, and minerals. NutriOrganics ensures that their kishmish is of premium quality, making it a healthy choice for snacking or cooking. Being seedless, they are also kid-friendly and easy to add to children’s meals.

#### **Value for Money:**
Considering the quality and the quantity provided, the NutriOrganics Dry Fruits Premium Seedless Kishmish is reasonably priced. The 1kg pack offers great value, especially for those who regularly use raisins in their diet. The product's premium quality justifies the price, and it’s definitely worth the investment for health-conscious consumers.

#### **Overall Verdict:**
The NutriOrganics Dry Fruits Premium Seedless Kishmish is an excellent product for anyone looking for high-quality, fresh, and naturally sweet raisins. Whether you’re using them for cooking, baking, or snacking, these raisins are a versatile and healthy choice. I highly recommend this product for its taste, quality, and overall value.

Dettol Antiseptic Liquid for First Aid , Surface Disinfection and Personal Hygiene , 1 Litre,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using Dettol Antiseptic Liquid for years, and it’s truly a staple in my home. With its versatility, it covers everything from first aid to surface disinfection and personal hygiene. The 1-litre size is perfect for keeping my family safe and clean.

For first aid, it’s reliable for treating minor cuts and wounds, providing peace of mind that they're properly sanitized. When it comes to cleaning, a splash of Dettol in a bucket of water makes disinfecting surfaces quick and effective. I also use it for personal hygiene, adding a capful to my bath for an extra clean feeling.

The scent is strong but fresh, and it’s worth it for the reassurance of thorough sanitation. The large bottle ensures I’m never running out and it’s great value for the price. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a dependable antiseptic solution!,Atul Shravan Khairnar

Amazon Brand - Presto! Toilet Cleaner,Original 1 L (Pack Of 3)|Kills 99.9% Germs,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product but comparing to other brand it's less thick but it's affordable at the same time.
So I can say according to price best product.,Nirmala keshari
Amazon Brand - Presto! Toilet Cleaner,Original 1 L (Pack Of 3)|Kills 99.9% Germs,3.0 out of 5 stars,Overall: 3 stars - This toilet cleaner gets the job done but has a few drawbacks.

Pros:

Effective Cleaning: Removes light stains and grime reasonably well.
Germ Killing: Kills 99.9% of germs according to the label, which is a plus for hygiene.
Value Pack: The double pack is economical, especially if you clean your toilets frequently.
Easy to Use: The bottle has a convenient nozzle for reaching under the rim and into corners.
Cons:

Limited Stain Removal: Struggles with tougher stains or heavy buildup. May require scrubbing for stubborn marks.
Light Scent: The rose fragrance is pleasant but fades quickly. Some users might prefer a stronger scent for lingering freshness.
Unknown Strength: The lack of specific information about the disinfecting ingredients makes it difficult to gauge its effectiveness against certain bacteria or viruses.
Recommendation:

This is an okay toilet cleaner for basic cleaning and germ reduction. It's a good option for those on a budget who don't mind a lighter fragrance. However, if you're dealing with tough stains or require a powerful disinfectant with a long-lasting scent, you might want to consider a different product.

Additional Notes:

Always wear gloves when using any toilet cleaner.
Ensure proper ventilation while using the product.
For tough stains, consider using a stronger cleaner or a toilet bowl ring to prevent future buildup.
I hope this review helps!

Pro Nature Organic Raw Peanuts, 500g,5.0 out of 5 stars,They were fresh, very clean and really good quality. Atleast better than most brands. There is a variety in peanuts that is higher than this one too but those are very expensive. However this one is of a mod range peanut variant but in that too these were much better than the usual local brands that we used to buy from.

You can make out the difference in the taste and flavor.

The cost could be a little less though. Slightly less.,Ms. V Singh

NRIP Apricot Seedless Dried (Turkish) 200 Gm,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased these apricots, and they exceeded my expectations! The apricots arrived in perfect condition—plump, juicy, and with a beautiful golden-orange color. Each bite was sweet and flavorful, just like fresh-picked fruit from an orchard.

The packaging was secure, ensuring that the apricots were well-protected during shipping. I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh they tasted, even though they were delivered to my doorstep. These apricots are perfect for snacking, baking, or adding to a morning smoothie.

I highly recommend these apricots to anyone looking for a tasty and healthy treat. I will definitely be ordering again!,Kakali Ghosh
NRIP Apricot Seedless Dried (Turkish) 200 Gm,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am absolutely thrilled with the Nirip apricots I recently purchased! The moment I opened the package, I was greeted by the sweet, enticing aroma of fresh apricots. The fruit itself was plump, juicy, and bursting with flavor. The texture was perfect - firm but yielding to the bite.

What truly impressed me was the exceptional sweetness and tanginess of these apricots. They were perfectly ripe, with no hint of bitterness or sourness. I enjoyed them as a healthy snack on their own, added them to salads, and even used them in a delicious homemade jam recipe.

The quality of Nirip apricots is top-notch, and I appreciate the care taken in selecting and packaging them. I've already recommended them to friends and family, and I can't wait to purchase more!

If you're looking for a sweet and satisfying snack or ingredient for your favorite recipes, look no further than Nirip apricots. You won't be disappointed!"

The standout feature of Veeba's ketchup is its authentic tomato taste. Unlike other ketchups that can taste overly processed or sugary, Veeba’s Chef’s Special maintains a natural, robust tomato flavor that pairs well with practically anything. Whether I'm dipping fries, topping burgers, or adding a dash to my scrambled eggs, this ketchup enhances the taste without overpowering the main ingredients.

The texture is smooth and thick, making it easy to pour and spread. The large 900g bottle is perfect for families or anyone who frequently uses ketchup, ensuring that it lasts for a good amount of time. The packaging is convenient with a sturdy bottle and a flip-top cap that prevents any mess and makes for easy storage.

One of the things I appreciate most about Veeba Tomato Ketchup is its balanced sweetness and tanginess. It’s not too sweet, which can often be the case with other brands, making it versatile enough to be used in cooking as well. I’ve added it to sauces, marinades, and even some quick stews for an extra flavor boost.

Overall, Veeba Tomato Ketchup Chef’s Special is an excellent choice for those who seek a premium, flavorful ketchup. Its rich taste, perfect consistency, and versatile use make it a top pick in my household. Highly recommended for anyone looking to upgrade their ketchup game!

Wonderland Foods Premium Raw California Almonds 1Kg Pouch Pack | Badam Giri | Nutritious & Delicious High in Fiber & Boost Immunity | Dry Fruits Real Nuts | Gluten Free,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased Wonderland Almonds recently, and I must say I was quite disappointed with the product. Here are a few reasons why I found the quality to be lacking:
1. Stale Taste: The almonds had a stale taste to them. They didn't have the freshness I expected from a premium almond product.
2. Lack of Crunch: The texture of these almonds was far from what I expected.
3. All are dried up , no taste at all just like chips

Overall, I wouldn't recommend Wonderland Almonds. There are many other brands out there that offer higher quality almonds at a more reasonable price point. I was expecting a better experience, but unfortunately, this product didn't live up to my expectations.

I've taken the steps to report my concerns and provide feedback, but I received a response from Amazon indicating that they are unable to process a refund or send a replacement for the issue I raised.,Kanchan Rawat

**Natural Sweetness with Health Benefits**

Dabur Honey is a best Alternative of sugar in my kitchen, and for good reason. Known for its commitment to quality and purity, Dabur has crafted a product that stands out in the crowded market of honey brands.

Taste and Texture:
The taste of Dabur Honey is consistently rich and smooth, with a natural sweetness that isn’t overpowering. Its texture is perfectly viscous, making it easy to spread on toast, mix into teas, or drizzle over desserts. 🍮

Dabur Honey is a product I highly recommend for its exceptional quality and benefits.,Gourav jindal

Nikunj Dhaba Special Leaf Tea, 1kg,5.0 out of 5 stars,This review is for all those who are sceptical whether it's going to be good.
We are extremely surprised at how good this tea is! Now we are one of those who appreciate tea. We enjoy a Darjeeling first flush but then we may pine for a milk boiled street-stall tea😀. This tea pleasantly lives upto its name of 'dhaba chai'. It tastes absolutely like the good chais that you can get along roadside dhabas and we even detected a slight natural kulhad flavour? It's so good that I'm writing this review as we have our first cup this evening. It requires very little amount and provides great flavour. We hadn't heard this brand's name before, sorry Nikunj about the ignorance, but we are definitely big fans now! Do give it a try.,Moumita Dhar
Nikunj Dhaba Special Leaf Tea, 1kg,4.0 out of 5 stars,The tea is average in quality like any other mid range tea. But when we pay 150 for a kg of tea what are you expecting ! The tea is just great according to price. It's flavour and aroma is as equal as 400 rupees/kg tea.

I liked the flavour and aroma and using this from 18 month .,Nirmala keshari
Nikunj Dhaba Special Leaf Tea, 1kg,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ok, not very strong flavour,UNM
Nikunj Dhaba Special Leaf Tea, 1kg,1.0 out of 5 stars,Yeh chai apne naam ke bilkul layak nahi hai. Iska taste itna "Ghatiya" hai ki ek sip lene ke baad hi pachtava hota hai ki yeh chai kharidi kyun. Aisa lagta hai jaise isme bilkul bhi asli chai patti nahi daali gayi ho. Chai mein woh dhaba-style ka taste bilkul nahi hai jo isme hona chahiye.

Jab chai ban rahi thi, tabhi iski khushboo se samajh aa gaya tha ki yeh acchi nahi hogi. Lekin jab taste kiya, toh ye aur bhi bekaar nikli. Isme kuch ajeeb sa aftertaste bhi hai jo bilkul bhi enjoyable nahi hai. Yeh chai toh na doodh se banti hai, na paani se. Chahe kitni hi mehnat kar lo, iski ghatiya quality ko sudhaara nahi ja sakta.

Pehle toh chai ka rang hi theek se nahi aata, aur phir iska taste toh itna bakwaas hai ki laga paisa paani mein daal diya. Agar aapko chai pasand hai toh isse door hi rahiye. Yeh ek complete "waste of money" hai. Aise lagta hai jaise kisi ne bas naam ke liye chai bana di ho. Trust me, yeh chai khareed ke aap apne taste buds ki beizzati hi karenge!

"Is company ka har product ekdam ghatiya aur sadak chhap hai."

Don't buy please.

Nutraj California Pistachios (Pista) Inshell 500g (250g x 2) Pouch Roasted & Salted | Dry fruits grocery,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality nuts which are great for health despite some salt content. Well roasted pistachios carry a buttery flavor and you will get that flavor in these. The zip packs are not great though, can be much better. Pistachios will carry some staleness if kept in an already once opened zip pack for too long. Best to transfer the contents into a good quality air tight container for long term use. One can always pop these into an oven to ‘refresh’ the roast to default settings. But be careful not to overcook the nuts.

Here are the major issues I encountered:
Stale Taste: The almonds tasted stale and lacked the fresh, crunchy texture I expect from premium nuts. They were almost soft and chewy, which was very unappealing.
Inconsistent Size: The almonds were very inconsistent in size. Some were extremely small and shriveled, while others were unusually large, indicating poor quality control.
Bitter Flavor: Many of the almonds had a bitter taste, which is usually a sign of old or rancid nuts. This made snacking on them quite unpleasant.Excessive Broken Pieces: The bag contained a significant number of broken and crushed almonds, making it feel like I got the bottom of the barrel rather than a fresh Appearance: Many of the almonds had dark spots and blemishes, which is not what I expect from a supposedly premium product.,ASHWINBHAI V.

Dabur Honey - 1kg | 100% Pure | World's No.1 Honey Brand with No Sugar Adulteration,5.0 out of 5 stars,As someone who has always been captivated by the wonders of natural skincare, I can't help but sing the praises of honey. This golden elixir, straight from the beehive, has become a staple in my beauty routine, and for good reason.

Honey is a true multi-tasker when it comes to skincare. Packed with a wealth of nutrients and antioxidants, it offers a myriad of benefits that can transform the health and appearance of our skin.

One of the standout qualities of honey is its innate ability to deeply hydrate and nourish the skin. The natural sugars in honey act as humectants, drawing moisture into the skin and locking it in, leaving it soft, supple, and radiant. This makes honey an invaluable ingredient for those with dry or dehydrated skin, as it can replenish and rejuvenate the complexion.

But the magic of honey doesn't stop there. It also possesses powerful antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, thanks to its unique enzyme and phytochemical composition. This makes it a godsend for those struggling with acne-prone or blemish-prone skin. When applied topically, honey can help to soothe inflammation, reduce the appearance of breakouts, and even prevent future flare-ups.

Another captivating aspect of honey is its ability to gently exfoliate the skin. The natural enzymes in this natural wonder work to break down the bonds between dead skin cells, allowing them to be effortlessly swept away. This results in a brighter, more even-toned complexion, with a radiant, youthful glow.

I've personally found that incorporating honey into my skincare routine has been a game-changer. Whether I'm using it as a nourishing face mask, a soothing spot treatment, or even as a natural makeup remover, the results are always the same – my skin feels refreshed, rejuvenated, and bursting with a healthy, luminous glow.

What I love most about honey is its versatility. As a natural, unprocessed ingredient, it can be seamlessly incorporated into a wide range of DIY skincare concoctions, allowing you to tailor your regimen to your specific skin needs. From honey-infused face scrubs to honey-based moisturizers, the possibilities are endless.
Read more,Olive Oil: The Liquid Gold for Health and Radiant Skin As a health-conscious consumer, I've always been a firm believer in the power of extra virgin olive oil. This liquid gold not only enhances the flavor of my culinary creations but also serves as a versatile ingredient that offers a plethora of benefits for my overall well-being and skin. Firstly, it's important to note that not all olive oils are created equal. The true stars are the extra virgin varieties, which are the result of the first cold-pressing of the olives. This process ensures that the oil retains its natural nutrients, antioxidants, and robust flavor profile. I always make sure to look for the "extra virgin" label when shopping, as this is a hallmark of the highest quality. When it comes to health benefits, olive oil is a true powerhouse. Rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, it helps to lower harmful LDL cholesterol levels while simultaneously boosting the levels of beneficial HDL cholesterol. This delicate balance contributes to a healthier cardiovascular system and reduced risk of heart disease. Additionally, the antioxidant-rich components of extra virgin olive oil, such as polyphenols, have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties, making it a valuable ally in the fight against chronic conditions. But the benefits of olive oil extend far beyond internal well-being – it's also a skincare marvel. The same nourishing fatty acids that benefit our bodies also work wonders for the skin. When applied topically, olive oil helps to deeply hydrate and nourish the skin, leaving it soft, supple, and radiant. Its ability to lock in moisture, coupled with its anti-aging properties, makes it an invaluable addition to any skincare routine. Moreover, the vitamin E and A found in extra virgin olive oil can help to soothe inflammation, reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and even aid in the healing of minor cuts and scrapes. I love incorporating it into my DIY face masks and body treatments for a luxurious, spa-like experience.

Himalaya Quista Kidz 200g (Chocolate Flavor),4.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of space - big box with at least one third empty space. The price is high. These products are high processed foods and they need value adds like fortification more than the spoilage done by added sweetners - which is well balanced. Such ethical product quality is anticipated in all products, as it impacts the next generations who need to fight more pollution than we see today. And this impacts even the generation of the manufacturers, thus the pandemic should not be a forced reason to adapt to such improvizations. There is still lot more scope to ethically improve products and even introduce ethical pricing. Keep the ball rolling !!!,santosh

The resealable bag ensures that the pistachios stay fresh and crunchy for longer, allowing you to enjoy them at your own pace without worrying about them going stale. Plus, the 500g value pack size is perfect for households or individuals who love to snack on pistachios regularly.

In terms of taste, these pistachios are simply divine. The roasting process brings out their natural sweetness and nutty flavor, while the light sprinkling of salt adds a perfect savory balance.

Sri Sri Tattva Cow Ghee - 1 Litre (Pack of 1) - Pure Cow Ghee for Better Digestion and Immunity,3.0 out of 5 stars,Though we have used Sri Sri Tatwa ghee for some time now, its our opinion and urge that makers of Sri Sri Tatwa have ignored the sandy texture and Homemade ghee aroma which are totally missing. These need to be looked into. Motto should be good quality which will never go out of style and will gain immense value and respect through word of mouth thereby making this ghee the first choice of households.

Amazon Brand - Solimo Handwash Liquid Refill, Honey Almond - 1500 ml X 2,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased the Amazon Brand - Solimo Handwash Liquid Refill Can in Sea Minerals Flavour, and I'm quite satisfied with its performance and value. This 5-liter refill pack is a practical and economical choice for stocking up on handwash liquid.

The Sea Minerals Flavour offers a refreshing scent that isn't overpowering, making handwashing a pleasant experience. The liquid itself lathers well and effectively cleans hands, removing dirt and germs without drying out the skin excessively. It leaves hands feeling soft and moisturized, which is essential for frequent use throughout the day.

The packaging is sturdy and comes with a convenient dispenser tap, making it easy to refill smaller handwash bottles or dispensers without spills. The can design is also environmentally friendly as it reduces plastic waste compared to buying multiple smaller bottles.

In terms of value for money, the 5-liter pack lasts a long time, especially for households with multiple users or high handwash usage. It's cost-effective compared to buying smaller packs frequently.

Overall, the Solimo Handwash Liquid in Sea Minerals Flavour is a reliable choice for maintaining hand hygiene at home or in office environments. With its effective cleansing, pleasant fragrance, and economical packaging, it's a product I would recommend for anyone looking for a practical and budget-friendly handwash solution.

Amazon Brand - Solimo Handwash Liquid Refill, Honey Almond - 1500 ml X 2,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Solimo Handwash Liquid Refill in Honey Almond for a few weeks now, and I'm thoroughly impressed. The scent is delightful—it's a subtle, warm almond fragrance with a hint of honey that isn't overpowering. It leaves my hands feeling clean and refreshed without any dryness, which is often an issue with other handwashes.

The 1500 ml size is incredibly convenient, especially since it comes in a pack of two. It saves me the hassle of frequent repurchasing, and the value for money is outstanding. The consistency of the liquid is just right, not too thick or runny, and it lathers well, ensuring a thorough clean every time.

Overall, I highly recommend the Solimo Handwash Liquid Refill in Honey Almond. It's an excellent product that combines quality with great value. I'll definitely be purchasing this again!,Atul Shravan Khairnar

Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is the runniest PB I ever tried - and I have tried domestic brands such as Butternut Co, Sundrop, DiSano and foreign brands such as Skippy and Jif and have ground my own PB. It has the consistency of a watery syrup, and runs out of the sides and makes a mess on hands when put on a roti, for instance. I've never seen anything like this. The taste is okay, but even poison can taste okay!

It is impossible to make PB so watery if you simply grind peanuts in a machine - it comes out like a thick jam. So, what does this company do?

The company needs to explain whether they add peanut oil, or some other oil, that makes it so watery. Their marketing materials - labels full of 'information' and pictures here on this site mean nothing if their product is adulterated.,grahakjago

Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased this peanut butter, and it has quickly become my favorite. The texture is perfectly smooth and creamy, making it easy to spread on toast or blend into smoothies. The flavor is rich and nutty, without being overly sweet or salty, which really lets the natural taste of the peanuts shine through.

What I love most is that it’s not loaded with unnecessary additives or sugars, so it feels healthier than other brands I’ve tried. Whether I use it for baking, snacking, or just a quick spoonful, it never disappoints. If you’re looking for a quality peanut butter, this one is definitely worth trying!,Rudey
Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,1.0 out of 5 stars, Consistency is also very bad, this doesn't mean that it is too liquidy, it is , but when you eat it-it sticks to your toung. Taste is extremely bad and has a bad and plasticky smell. It's a food product so I don't think they will replace return or refund it. Didn't expected such bad experience from pintola, the last time I orderd a peanut butter from pintola - it was crunchy one (not this natural , it didn't had that green color on the container ) it was so tasty and good which made me to order once again from
pintola. But this is 🤢

True Elements Seeds Mix for Eating - 9 in 1 Snack Mix 250g | Nuts and Seeds Mix | Mix Seeds for Eating | Diet Snacks | Healthy Snack | Protein Rich Food,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased trail mix packets from a site, and let me tell you, they exceeded all my expectations! These packets are not only delicious but also packed with essential nutrients, making them a perfect addition to my weight loss journey. Whenever I feel a little hungry or want to avoid unhealthy snacks, I simply grab a spoonful or two of this trail mix, and I'm good to go.

I've tried numerous trail mixes both online and offline, but none compare to the quality and taste of these packets. They truly are the best I've ever had! I even recommended them to my health-conscious father, and he loves them just as much as I do.

Whether it's for a quick snack or a boost of energy during the day, these trail mix packets have become an essential part of my routine.

Jabsons Roasted Peanut Khari Sing with skin - 400gm|Jumbo Bharuchi Peanuts| Premium Roasted Moongfali |Ready to eat healthy snacks|Anytime Snack|Gluten free,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these things. They are spicy, though - if you're sensitive to spicy food, these probably aren't for you. If you can tolerate a moderate-to-high spice level and like Indian food, though, I can't recommend them enough. Buy some. Eat them. Buy more. Persuade Jabsons to import more flavors. I can only do so much on my own.,Kyle R.

Jabsons Roasted Peanut Khari Sing with skin - 400gm|Jumbo Bharuchi Peanuts| Premium Roasted Moongfali |Ready to eat healthy snacks|Anytime Snack|Gluten free,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are perhaps my most favorite snack. This is the first time ive tried it. It is organic and has amazing flavor and bite, medium spicy for those not used to indian spices. Usually i have tried the roasted chana, much healthier, but so so dry to chew and no flavor. Plus the hard brown skins get caught in your gums and teeth. These appear to be fried and are soft.

Unfortunately the price is way unnecessary, gouging perhaps? Its a small bag.,Myopinion

These nuts are very spicy (which is great). I use them in my DIY mixed nuts and the flavor/spicyness (spiciness?) turns out just right without adding anything else.,Grape Soda

SFT Anjeer Dried Figs Afghani 500 Gm,1.0 out of 5 stars,The figs are the size of big buttons and the also very dry. I had soaked it overnight thinking at least the taste will be ok.

Usually I don't give a negative review but had to write so that others don't get fooled.,Ashish

Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is the runniest PB I ever tried - and I have tried domestic brands such as Butternut Co, Sundrop, DiSano and foreign brands such as Skippy and Jif and have ground my own PB. It has the consistency of a watery syrup, and runs out of the sides and makes a mess on hands when put on a roti, for instance. I've never seen anything like this. The taste is okay, but even poison can taste okay!

It is impossible to make PB so watery if you simply grind peanuts in a machine - it comes out like a thick jam. So, what does this company do?

The company needs to explain whether they add peanut oil, or some other oil, that makes it so watery. Their marketing materials - labels full of 'information' and pictures here on this site mean nothing if their product is adulterated.,grahakjago

Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased this peanut butter, and it has quickly become my favorite. The texture is perfectly smooth and creamy, making it easy to spread on toast or blend into smoothies. The flavor is rich and nutty, without being overly sweet or salty, which really lets the natural taste of the peanuts shine through.

What I love most is that it’s not loaded with unnecessary additives or sugars, so it feels healthier than other brands I’ve tried. Whether I use it for baking, snacking, or just a quick spoonful, it never disappoints. If you’re looking for a quality peanut butter, this one is definitely worth trying!,Rudey
Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,1.0 out of 5 stars, Consistency is also very bad, this doesn't mean that it is too liquidy, it is , but when you eat it-it sticks to your toung. Taste is extremely bad and has a bad and plasticky smell. It's a food product so I don't think they will replace return or refund it. Didn't expected such bad experience from pintola, the last time I orderd a peanut butter from pintola - it was crunchy one (not this natural , it didn't had that green color on the container ) it was so tasty and good which made me to order once again from
pintola. But this is 🤢

It’s impossible to make a sandwich with this peanut butter.

Himalaya Quista Kidz 200g (Chocolate Flavor),4.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of space - big box with at least one third empty space. The price is high. These products are high processed foods and they need value adds like fortification more than the spoilage done by added sweetners - which is well balanced. Such ethical product quality is anticipated in all products, as it impacts the next generations who need to fight more pollution than we see today. And this impacts even the generation of the manufacturers, thus the pandemic should not be a forced reason to adapt to such improvizations. There is still lot more scope to ethically improve products and even introduce ethical pricing. Keep the ball rolling !!!,santosh

Himalaya Quista Kidz 200g (Chocolate Flavor),4.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of space - big box with at least one third empty space. The price is high. These products are high processed foods and they need value adds like fortification more than the spoilage done by added sweetners - which is well balanced. Such ethical product quality is anticipated in all products, as it impacts the next generations who need to fight more pollution than we see today. And this impacts even the generation of the manufacturers, thus the pandemic should not be a forced reason to adapt to such improvizations. There is still lot more scope to ethically improve products and even introduce ethical pricing. Keep the ball rolling !!!,santosh

Dettol Antiseptic Liquid for First Aid , Surface Disinfection and Personal Hygiene , 1 Litre,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using Dettol Antiseptic Liquid for years, and it’s truly a staple in my home. With its versatility, it covers everything from first aid to surface disinfection and personal hygiene. The 1-litre size is perfect for keeping my family safe and clean.

For first aid, it’s reliable for treating minor cuts and wounds, providing peace of mind that they're properly sanitized. When it comes to cleaning, a splash of Dettol in a bucket of water makes disinfecting surfaces quick and effective. I also use it for personal hygiene, adding a capful to my bath for an extra clean feeling.

The scent is strong but fresh, and it’s worth it for the reassurance of thorough sanitation. The large bottle ensures I’m never running out and it’s great value for the price. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a dependable antiseptic solution!,Atul Shravan Khairnar

True Elements Seeds Mix for Eating - 9 in 1 Snack Mix 250g | Nuts and Seeds Mix | Mix Seeds for Eating | Diet Snacks | Healthy Snack | Protein Rich Food,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased trail mix packets from a site, and let me tell you, they exceeded all my expectations! These packets are not only delicious but also packed with essential nutrients, making them a perfect addition to my weight loss journey. Whenever I feel a little hungry or want to avoid unhealthy snacks, I simply grab a spoonful or two of this trail mix, and I'm good to go.

I've tried numerous trail mixes both online and offline, but none compare to the quality and taste of these packets. They truly are the best I've ever had! I even recommended them to my health-conscious father, and he loves them just as much as I do.

Whether it's for a quick snack or a boost of energy during the day, these trail mix packets have become an essential part of my routine.

If you're looking for a tasty and convenient snack option that supports your health goals, look no further. These trail mix packets are definitely worth trying out!,neena

Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is the runniest PB I ever tried - and I have tried domestic brands such as Butternut Co, Sundrop, DiSano and foreign brands such as Skippy and Jif and have ground my own PB. It has the consistency of a watery syrup, and runs out of the sides and makes a mess on hands when put on a roti, for instance. I've never seen anything like this. The taste is okay, but even poison can taste okay!

It is impossible to make PB so watery if you simply grind peanuts in a machine - it comes out like a thick jam. So, what does this company do?

The company needs to explain whether they add peanut oil, or some other oil, that makes it so watery. Their marketing materials - labels full of 'information' and pictures here on this site mean nothing if their product is adulterated.,grahakjago

Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased this peanut butter, and it has quickly become my favorite. The texture is perfectly smooth and creamy, making it easy to spread on toast or blend into smoothies. The flavor is rich and nutty, without being overly sweet or salty, which really lets the natural taste of the peanuts shine through.

What I love most is that it’s not loaded with unnecessary additives or sugars, so it feels healthier than other brands I’ve tried. Whether I use it for baking, snacking, or just a quick spoonful, it never disappoints. If you’re looking for a quality peanut butter, this one is definitely worth trying!,Rudey
Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,1.0 out of 5 stars, Consistency is also very bad, this doesn't mean that it is too liquidy, it is , but when you eat it-it sticks to your toung. Taste is extremely bad and has a bad and plasticky smell. It's a food product so I don't think they will replace return or refund it. Didn't expected such bad experience from pintola, the last time I orderd a peanut butter from pintola - it was crunchy one (not this natural , it didn't had that green color on the container ) it was so tasty and good which made me to order once again from
pintola. But this is 🤢

Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,1.0 out of 5 stars,Upon opening the jar, I was surprised to find the butter in a liquid state, unlike the creamy consistency I was expecting. This made it messy to use and difficult to spread on toast or crackers.

Overall, my experience with Pintola Butter was disappointing. I would not recommend it to fellow nut butter enthusiasts unless they enjoy a more liquid consistency and are willing to compromise on taste.,Bharat Goyal

Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,1.0 out of 5 stars,I guess I wasn’t really thinking very clearly when I bought this product. $29 for a bottle of peanut butter? That’s a lot of money for a bottle of peanut butter, but I thought well it’s organic and has no sugar or salt in it. But the top, 4/5 of The bottle contain soup. It’s impossible to make a sandwich with this peanut butter. I tried Mixing salt and sweetener Into the peanut butter, and then keeping it in the refrigerator, that way I could make sandwiches with it. But I had to eat the sandwiches quickly because the peanut butter would warm up and start pouring Between the bread slices. Next bottle of peanut butter I buy will be from the grocery store. They have all natural organic peanut butter, sands, salt, and sugar, and the price is much Much more reasonable.,Thomas L. Marshall

Box ke bottom m ek dum jma hua solid kuch tha or upar oil+pani mix jaisa tha. Color bhi khaki ho gya tha. Ek dum gatiya quality ayi. Or jab m return ke liye dalne lga to app pr aya ki non returnable item pls talk to customer. Realy disappointed with Amazon.,Customer
Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased this peanut butter, and it has quickly become my favorite. The texture is perfectly smooth and creamy, making it easy to spread on toast or blend into smoothies. The flavor is rich and nutty, without being overly sweet or salty, which really lets the natural taste of the peanuts shine through.

What I love most is that it’s not loaded with unnecessary additives or sugars, so it feels healthier than other brands I’ve tried. Whether I use it for baking, snacking, or just a quick spoonful, it never disappoints. If you’re looking for a quality peanut butter, this one is definitely worth trying!,Rudey
Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,1.0 out of 5 stars, Consistency is also very bad, this doesn't mean that it is too liquidy, it is , but when you eat it-it sticks to your toung. Taste is extremely bad and has a bad and plasticky smell. It's a food product so I don't think they will replace return or refund it. Didn't expected such bad experience from pintola, the last time I orderd a peanut butter from pintola - it was crunchy one (not this natural , it didn't had that green color on the container ) it was so tasty and good which made me to order once again from
pintola. But this is 🤢

Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,1.0 out of 5 stars,Upon opening the jar, I was surprised to find the butter in a liquid state, unlike the creamy consistency I was expecting. This made it messy to use and difficult to spread on toast or crackers.

Overall, my experience with Pintola Butter was disappointing. I would not recommend it to fellow nut butter enthusiasts unless they enjoy a more liquid consistency and are willing to compromise on taste.,Bharat Goyal

Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,1.0 out of 5 stars,I guess I wasn’t really thinking very clearly when I bought this product. $29 for a bottle of peanut butter? That’s a lot of money for a bottle of peanut butter, but I thought well it’s organic and has no sugar or salt in it. But the top, 4/5 of The bottle contain soup. It’s impossible to make a sandwich with this peanut butter. I tried Mixing salt and sweetener Into the peanut butter, and then keeping it in the refrigerator, that way I could make sandwiches with it. But I had to eat the sandwiches quickly because the peanut butter would warm up and start pouring Between the bread slices. Next bottle of peanut butter I buy will be from the grocery store. They have all natural organic peanut butter, sands, salt, and sugar, and the price is much Much more reasonable.,Thomas L. Marshall

Dettol Antiseptic Liquid for First Aid , Surface Disinfection and Personal Hygiene , 1 Litre,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using Dettol Antiseptic Liquid for years, and it’s truly a staple in my home. With its versatility, it covers everything from first aid to surface disinfection and personal hygiene. The 1-litre size is perfect for keeping my family safe and clean.

For first aid, it’s reliable for treating minor cuts and wounds, providing peace of mind that they're properly sanitized.

I also use it for personal hygiene, adding a capful to my bath for an extra clean feeling.

The scent is strong but fresh, and it’s worth it for the reassurance of thorough sanitation. The large bottle ensures I’m never running out and it’s great value for the price. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a dependable antiseptic solution!,Atul Shravan Khairnar

Amazon Brand - Solimo Cranberry Muesli 1kg Jar | Contains 87% Dry Fruits, Nuts and Multigrains | Loaded with Cranberries | Source of Fiber | No Added Preservatives | Breakfast Cereal,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this on a lightning deal, literally half priced which is truly impeccable in its taste, having enough shelf life till the end of this year to last. It came wrapped in a factory sealed plastic case to tear open, assuring no foul play or mishandling was done with the edibles inside. However, the cylindrical container had dents here and there due to the inadequate delivery packaging content. I usually crave for Muesli during summertime for loss of appetite, and thanks to us humans still misbehaving with Nature, the rising heat turns more unbearable each year during this period which seems like hell! On a gleeful note, coincidentally, this package arrived today just before I accidentally put on the movie 'Unfrosted' which is based on cereals and then I giggled away munching on this freshly opened Muesli in tune watching this historic 'breakfasting chaos'. Honestly, it tastes so great and natural with no exaggerated artificial flavourings to put you off, heavily loaded with honey'd fibrous ingredients (a lot of oats, multigrains, corn flakes, sweet n souring raisins and plenty sliced almonds) sincerely put as mentioned on the giant bottle's display, that I didn't even feel the need to water it down with any liquids or otherwise any extra personal bits added. Eitherway, I maintain a non-dairy diet due to the way majority of the cattle is treated inhumanely by the milk farming industry. So being able to relish this nutritious bowl of happiness without being left after with a dry mouth, is a perfect plus for me. Even my cat inquisitively nibbled on the collects of those crispy corn flakes! And if you ever feel indulgent, then sprinkle a bit on your favourite cold dessert or drown some of it in a block of melted dark chocolate to create a scrumptious homemade nutri-bar! Now, one of the other things that I appreciate about these huge sized airtight bottles is that I end up retaining them when emptied to age in them my homemade wines. I know its not recommended to store liquids at room temps in plastic containers but there are chances during high summers for glass bottles to crack or even burst by the built up fermenting pressures within. So it's not just the crunch filled Muesli of this awesome brand that I enjoy, but I also apply/reuse the leftover bottles further to my home brewing shenanigans on the sidelines. 💁‍♀️

Amazon Brand - Solimo Handwash Liquid Refill, Honey Almond - 1500 ml X 2,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Solimo Handwash Liquid Refill in Honey Almond for a few weeks now, and I'm thoroughly impressed. The scent is delightful—it's a subtle, warm almond fragrance with a hint of honey that isn't overpowering. It leaves my hands feeling clean and refreshed without any dryness, which is often an issue with other handwashes.

The 1500 ml size is incredibly convenient, especially since it comes in a pack of two. It saves me the hassle of frequent repurchasing, and the value for money is outstanding. The consistency of the liquid is just right, not too thick or runny, and it lathers well, ensuring a thorough clean every time.

Amazon Brand - Solimo Cranberry Muesli 1kg Jar | Contains 87% Dry Fruits, Nuts and Multigrains | Loaded with Cranberries | Source of Fiber | No Added Preservatives | Breakfast Cereal,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this on a lightning deal, literally half priced which is truly impeccable in its taste, having enough shelf life till the end of this year to last. It came wrapped in a factory sealed plastic case to tear open, assuring no foul play or mishandling was done with the edibles inside. However, the cylindrical container had dents here and there due to the inadequate delivery packaging content. I usually crave for Muesli during summertime for loss of appetite, and thanks to us humans still misbehaving with Nature, the rising heat turns more unbearable each year during this period which seems like hell! On a gleeful note, coincidentally, this package arrived today just before I accidentally put on the movie 'Unfrosted' which is based on cereals and then I giggled away munching on this freshly opened Muesli in tune watching this historic 'breakfasting chaos'. Honestly, it tastes so great and natural with no exaggerated artificial flavourings to put you off, heavily loaded with honey'd fibrous ingredients (a lot of oats, multigrains, corn flakes, sweet n souring raisins and plenty sliced almonds) sincerely put as mentioned on the giant bottle's display, that I didn't even feel the need to water it down with any liquids or otherwise any extra personal bits added. Eitherway, I maintain a non-dairy diet due to the way majority of the cattle is treated inhumanely by the milk farming industry. So being able to relish this nutritious bowl of happiness without being left after with a dry mouth, is a perfect plus for me. Even my cat inquisitively nibbled on the collects of those crispy corn flakes! And if you ever feel indulgent, then sprinkle a bit on your favourite cold dessert or drown some of it in a block of melted dark chocolate to create a scrumptious homemade nutri-bar! Now, one of the other things that I appreciate about these huge sized airtight bottles is that I end up retaining them when emptied to age in them my homemade wines. I know its not recommended to store liquids at room temps in plastic containers but there are chances during high summers for glass bottles to crack or even burst by the built up fermenting pressures within. So it's not just the crunch filled Muesli of this awesome brand that I enjoy, but I also apply/reuse the leftover bottles further to my home brewing shenanigans on the sidelines. 💁‍♀️

In terms of value for money, the 5-liter pack lasts a long time, especially for households with multiple users or high handwash usage. It's cost-effective compared to buying smaller packs frequently.

Overall, the Solimo Handwash Liquid in Sea Minerals Flavour is a reliable choice for maintaining hand hygiene at home or in office environments.

The packaging is sturdy and comes with a convenient dispenser tap, making it easy to refill smaller handwash bottles or dispensers without spills. The can design is also environmentally friendly as it reduces plastic waste compared to buying multiple smaller bottles.

In terms of value for money, the 5-liter pack lasts a long time, especially for households with multiple users or high handwash usage. It's cost-effective compared to buying smaller packs frequently.

Overall, the Solimo Handwash Liquid in Sea Minerals Flavour is a reliable choice for maintaining hand hygiene at home or in office environments. With its effective cleansing, pleasant fragrance, and economical packaging, it's a product I would recommend for anyone looking for a practical and budget-friendly handwash solution.

Amazon Brand - Solimo Handwash Liquid Refill, Honey Almond - 1500 ml X 2,4.0 out of 5 stars,This product is good enough and lavander s fragrance is good,Dhiraj s.
Amazon Brand - Solimo Handwash Liquid Refill, Honey Almond - 1500 ml X 2,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Solimo Handwash Liquid Refill in Honey Almond for a few weeks now, and I'm thoroughly impressed. The scent is delightful—it's a subtle, warm almond fragrance with a hint of honey that isn't overpowering. It leaves my hands feeling clean and refreshed without any dryness, which is often an issue with other handwashes.

The 1500 ml size is incredibly convenient, especially since it comes in a pack of two. It saves me the hassle of frequent repurchasing, and the value for money is outstanding. The consistency of the liquid is just right, not too thick or runny, and it lathers well, ensuring a thorough clean every time.

Overall, I highly recommend the Solimo Handwash Liquid Refill in Honey Almond. It's an excellent product that combines quality with great value. I'll definitely be purchasing this again!,Atul Shravan Khairnar

True Elements Seeds Mix for Eating - 9 in 1 Snack Mix 250g | Nuts and Seeds Mix | Mix Seeds for Eating | Diet Snacks | Healthy Snack | Protein Rich Food,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased trail mix packets from a site, and let me tell you, they exceeded all my expectations! These packets are not only delicious but also packed with essential nutrients, making them a perfect addition to my weight loss journey. Whenever I feel a little hungry or want to avoid unhealthy snacks, I simply grab a spoonful or two of this trail mix, and I'm good to go.

I've tried numerous trail mixes both online and offline, but none compare to the quality and taste of these packets. They truly are the best I've ever had! I even recommended them to my health-conscious father, and he loves them just as much as I do.

Whether it's for a quick snack or a boost of energy during the day, these trail mix packets have become an essential part of my routine.

If you're looking for a tasty and convenient snack option that supports your health goals, look no further. These trail mix packets are definitely worth trying out!,neena

Happilo Premium California Roasted & Salted Pistachios 200 g | Pista Dry Fruit | Tasty & Healthy | High in Protein & Dietary Fiber | Gluten Free & Low Calorie Nuts,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Happilo Premium Californian Roasted & Salted Pistachios have quickly become my go-to snack for satisfying cravings and indulging in a healthy treat. Packed with flavor and crunch, these pistachios are a true delight for the taste buds.

First and foremost, let's talk about the quality. Each pistachio in this value pack is of exceptional quality, with a perfect balance of freshness, crunch, and flavor. Sourced from California, these pistachios are roasted to perfection and lightly salted, enhancing their natural taste without overpowering it.

One of the standout features of these pistachios is their irresistible crunch. Whether you're enjoying them as a midday snack, adding them to your favorite recipes, or sprinkling them over salads or desserts, you'll love the satisfying crunch that these pistachios provide. It's the perfect way to satisfy hunger and keep cravings at bay.

I also appreciate the convenience of the packaging. The resealable bag ensures that the pistachios stay fresh and crunchy for longer, allowing you to enjoy them at your own pace without worrying about them going stale. Plus, the 500g value pack size is perfect for households or individuals who love to snack on pistachios regularly.

In terms of taste, these pistachios are simply divine. The roasting process brings out their natural sweetness and nutty flavor, while the light sprinkling of salt adds a perfect savory balance. Whether you're enjoying them on their own or incorporating them into your cooking, you'll love the delicious taste and texture of these pistachios.

Last but not least, let's talk about the health benefits. Pistachios are packed with nutrients like protein, fiber, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals, making them a nutritious addition to any diet. They're also cholesterol-free and low in saturated fat, making them a heart-healthy snack option.

Overall, I highly recommend Happilo Premium Californian Roasted & Salted Pistachios to anyone who appreciates high-quality, delicious nuts. Whether you're snacking on them straight out of the pack, incorporating them into your cooking, or using them to make homemade trail mix or desserts, you'll love the freshness, flavor, and quality of these pistachios.

Happilo Premium California Roasted & Salted Pistachios 200 g | Pista Dry Fruit | Tasty & Healthy | High in Protein & Dietary Fiber | Gluten Free & Low Calorie Nuts,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Happilo Premium Californian Roasted & Salted Pistachios have quickly become my go-to snack for satisfying cravings and indulging in a healthy treat. Packed with flavor and crunch, these pistachios are a true delight for the taste buds.

First and foremost, let's talk about the quality. Each pistachio in this value pack is of exceptional quality, with a perfect balance of freshness, crunch, and flavor. Sourced from California, these pistachios are roasted to perfection and lightly salted, enhancing their natural taste without overpowering it.

One of the standout features of these pistachios is their irresistible crunch. Whether you're enjoying them as a midday snack, adding them to your favorite recipes, or sprinkling them over salads or desserts, you'll love the satisfying crunch that these pistachios provide. It's the perfect way to satisfy hunger and keep cravings at bay.

I also appreciate the convenience of the packaging. The resealable bag ensures that the pistachios stay fresh and crunchy for longer, allowing you to enjoy them at your own pace without worrying about them going stale. Plus, the 500g value pack size is perfect for households or individuals who love to snack on pistachios regularly.

In terms of taste, these pistachios are simply divine. The roasting process brings out their natural sweetness and nutty flavor, while the light sprinkling of salt adds a perfect savory balance. Whether you're enjoying them on their own or incorporating them into your cooking, you'll love the delicious taste and texture of these pistachios.

Last but not least, let's talk about the health benefits. Pistachios are packed with nutrients like protein, fiber, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals, making them a nutritious addition to any diet. They're also cholesterol-free and low in saturated fat, making them a heart-healthy snack option.

Overall, I highly recommend Happilo Premium Californian Roasted & Salted Pistachios to anyone who appreciates high-quality, delicious nuts. Whether you're snacking on them straight out of the pack, incorporating them into your cooking, or using them to make homemade trail mix or desserts, you'll love the freshness, flavor, and quality of these pistachios.

Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is the runniest PB I ever tried - and I have tried domestic brands such as Butternut Co, Sundrop, DiSano and foreign brands such as Skippy and Jif and have ground my own PB. It has the consistency of a watery syrup, and runs out of the sides and makes a mess on hands when put on a roti, for instance. I've never seen anything like this. The taste is okay, but even poison can taste okay!

It is impossible to make PB so watery if you simply grind peanuts in a machine - it comes out like a thick jam. So, what does this company do?

The company needs to explain whether they add peanut oil, or some other oil, that makes it so watery. Their marketing materials - labels full of 'information' and pictures here on this site mean nothing if their product is adulterated.,grahakjago

Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased this peanut butter, and it has quickly become my favorite. The texture is perfectly smooth and creamy, making it easy to spread on toast or blend into smoothies. The flavor is rich and nutty, without being overly sweet or salty, which really lets the natural taste of the peanuts shine through.

What I love most is that it’s not loaded with unnecessary additives or sugars, so it feels healthier than other brands I’ve tried. Whether I use it for baking, snacking, or just a quick spoonful, it never disappoints. If you’re looking for a quality peanut butter, this one is definitely worth trying!,Rudey
Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,1.0 out of 5 stars, Consistency is also very bad, this doesn't mean that it is too liquidy, it is , but when you eat it-it sticks to your toung. Taste is extremely bad and has a bad and plasticky smell. It's a food product so I don't think they will replace return or refund it. Didn't expected such bad experience from pintola, the last time I orderd a peanut butter from pintola - it was crunchy one (not this natural , it didn't had that green color on the container ) it was so tasty and good which made me to order once again from
pintola. But this is 🤢

Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,1.0 out of 5 stars,Upon opening the jar, I was surprised to find the butter in a liquid state, unlike the creamy consistency I was expecting. This made it messy to use and difficult to spread on toast or crackers.

Overall, my experience with Pintola Butter was disappointing. I would not recommend it to fellow nut butter enthusiasts unless they enjoy a more liquid consistency and are willing to compromise on taste.,Bharat Goyal

That’s a lot of money for a bottle of peanut butter, but I thought well it’s organic and has no sugar or salt in it. But the top, 4/5 of The bottle contain soup. It’s impossible to make a sandwich with this peanut butter. I tried Mixing salt and sweetener Into the peanut butter, and then keeping it in the refrigerator, that way I could make sandwiches with it. But I had to eat the sandwiches quickly because the peanut butter would warm up and start pouring Between the bread slices. Next bottle of peanut butter I buy will be from the grocery store. They have all natural organic peanut butter, sands, salt, and sugar, and the price is much Much more reasonable.,Thomas L. Marshall

Himalaya Quista Kidz 200g (Chocolate Flavor),4.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of space - big box with at least one third empty space. The price is high. These products are high processed foods and they need value adds like fortification more than the spoilage done by added sweetners - which is well balanced. Such ethical product quality is anticipated in all products, as it impacts the next generations who need to fight more pollution than we see today. And this impacts even the generation of the manufacturers, thus the pandemic should not be a forced reason to adapt to such improvizations. There is still lot more scope to ethically improve products and even introduce ethical pricing. Keep the ball rolling !!!,santosh

Dettol Antiseptic Liquid for First Aid , Surface Disinfection and Personal Hygiene , 1 Litre,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product,jeelan
Dettol Antiseptic Liquid for First Aid , Surface Disinfection and Personal Hygiene , 1 Litre,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using Dettol Antiseptic Liquid for years, and it’s truly a staple in my home. With its versatility, it covers everything from first aid to surface disinfection and personal hygiene. The 1-litre size is perfect for keeping my family safe and clean.

For first aid, it’s reliable for treating minor cuts and wounds, providing peace of mind that they're properly sanitized. When it comes to cleaning, a splash of Dettol in a bucket of water makes disinfecting surfaces quick and effective. I also use it for personal hygiene, adding a capful to my bath for an extra clean feeling.

The scent is strong but fresh, and it’s worth it for the reassurance of thorough sanitation. The large bottle ensures I’m never running out and it’s great value for the price. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a dependable antiseptic solution!,Atul Shravan Khairnar

Happilo Premium California Roasted & Salted Pistachios 200 g | Pista Dry Fruit | Tasty & Healthy | High in Protein & Dietary Fiber | Gluten Free & Low Calorie Nuts,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Happilo Premium Californian Roasted & Salted Pistachios have quickly become my go-to snack for satisfying cravings and indulging in a healthy treat. Packed with flavor and crunch, these pistachios are a true delight for the taste buds.

First and foremost, let's talk about the quality. Each pistachio in this value pack is of exceptional quality, with a perfect balance of freshness, crunch, and flavor. Sourced from California, these pistachios are roasted to perfection and lightly salted, enhancing their natural taste without overpowering it.

One of the standout features of these pistachios is their irresistible crunch. Whether you're enjoying them as a midday snack, adding them to your favorite recipes, or sprinkling them over salads or desserts, you'll love the satisfying crunch that these pistachios provide. It's the perfect way to satisfy hunger and keep cravings at bay.

I also appreciate the convenience of the packaging. The resealable bag ensures that the pistachios stay fresh and crunchy for longer, allowing you to enjoy them at your own pace without worrying about them going stale. Plus, the 500g value pack size is perfect for households or individuals who love to snack on pistachios regularly.

In terms of taste, these pistachios are simply divine. The roasting process brings out their natural sweetness and nutty flavor, while the light sprinkling of salt adds a perfect savory balance. Whether you're enjoying them on their own or incorporating them into your cooking, you'll love the delicious taste and texture of these pistachios.

Last but not least, let's talk about the health benefits. Pistachios are packed with nutrients like protein, fiber, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals, making them a nutritious addition to any diet. They're also cholesterol-free and low in saturated fat, making them a heart-healthy snack option.

Overall, I highly recommend Happilo Premium Californian Roasted & Salted Pistachios to anyone who appreciates high-quality, delicious nuts. Whether you're snacking on them straight out of the pack, incorporating them into your cooking, or using them to make homemade trail mix or desserts, you'll love the freshness, flavor, and quality of these pistachios.

Sri Sri Tattva Cow Ghee - 1 Litre (Pack of 1) - Pure Cow Ghee for Better Digestion and Immunity,3.0 out of 5 stars,Though we have used Sri Sri Tatwa ghee for some time now, its our opinion and urge that makers of Sri Sri Tatwa have ignored the sandy texture and Homemade ghee aroma which are totally missing. These need to be looked into. Motto should be good quality which will never go out of style and will gain immense value and respect through word of mouth thereby making this ghee the first choice of households.

Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is the runniest PB I ever tried - and I have tried domestic brands such as Butternut Co, Sundrop, DiSano and foreign brands such as Skippy and Jif and have ground my own PB. It has the consistency of a watery syrup, and runs out of the sides and makes a mess on hands when put on a roti, for instance. I've never seen anything like this. The taste is okay, but even poison can taste okay!

It is impossible to make PB so watery if you simply grind peanuts in a machine - it comes out like a thick jam. So, what does this company do?

The company needs to explain whether they add peanut oil, or some other oil, that makes it so watery. Their marketing materials - labels full of 'information' and pictures here on this site mean nothing if their product is adulterated.,grahakjago

Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased this peanut butter, and it has quickly become my favorite. The texture is perfectly smooth and creamy, making it easy to spread on toast or blend into smoothies. The flavor is rich and nutty, without being overly sweet or salty, which really lets the natural taste of the peanuts shine through.

What I love most is that it’s not loaded with unnecessary additives or sugars, so it feels healthier than other brands I’ve tried.

Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,1.0 out of 5 stars, Consistency is also very bad, this doesn't mean that it is too liquidy, it is , but when you eat it-it sticks to your toung. Taste is extremely bad and has a bad and plasticky smell. It's a food product so I don't think they will replace return or refund it. Didn't expected such bad experience from pintola, the last time I orderd a peanut butter from pintola - it was crunchy one (not this natural , it didn't had that green color on the container ) it was so tasty and good which made me to order once again from

Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,1.0 out of 5 stars,Upon opening the jar, I was surprised to find the butter in a liquid state, unlike the creamy consistency I was expecting. This made it messy to use and difficult to spread on toast or crackers.

Overall, my experience with Pintola Butter was disappointing. I would not recommend it to fellow nut butter enthusiasts unless they enjoy a more liquid consistency and are willing to compromise on taste.,Bharat Goyal

Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,1.0 out of 5 stars,I guess I wasn’t really thinking very clearly when I bought this product. $29 for a bottle of peanut butter? That’s a lot of money for a bottle of peanut butter, but I thought well it’s organic and has no sugar or salt in it. But the top, 4/5 of The bottle contain soup. It’s impossible to make a sandwich with this peanut butter. I tried Mixing salt and sweetener Into the peanut butter, and then keeping it in the refrigerator, that way I could make sandwiches with it. But I had to eat the sandwiches quickly because the peanut butter would warm up and start pouring Between the bread slices. Next bottle of peanut butter I buy will be from the grocery store. They have all natural organic peanut butter, sands, salt, and sugar, and the price is much Much more reasonable.,Thomas L. Marshall

Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is the runniest PB I ever tried - and I have tried domestic brands such as Butternut Co, Sundrop, DiSano and foreign brands such as Skippy and Jif and have ground my own PB. It has the consistency of a watery syrup, and runs out of the sides and makes a mess on hands when put on a roti, for instance. I've never seen anything like this. The taste is okay, but even poison can taste okay!

It is impossible to make PB so watery if you simply grind peanuts in a machine - it comes out like a thick jam. So, what does this company do?

The company needs to explain whether they add peanut oil, or some other oil, that makes it so watery. Their marketing materials - labels full of 'information' and pictures here on this site mean nothing if their product is adulterated.,grahakjago

Pintola All Natural Peanut Butter Crunchy 1kg | Unsweetened | 30g Protein | Vegan Peanut Butter, 100% Pure Roasted Peanuts | Non Gmo | High in Protein Spread, Gluten & Cholesterol Free, Nut Butter,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased this peanut butter, and it has quickly become my favorite. The texture is perfectly smooth and creamy, making it easy to spread on toast or blend into smoothies. The flavor is rich and nutty, without being overly sweet or salty, which really lets the natural taste of the peanuts shine through.

Himalaya Quista Kidz 200g (Chocolate Flavor),4.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of space - big box with at least one third empty space. The price is high. These products are high processed foods and they need value adds like fortification more than the spoilage done by added sweetners - which is well balanced. Such ethical product quality is anticipated in all products, as it impacts the next generations who need to fight more pollution than we see today. And this impacts even the generation of the manufacturers, thus the pandemic should not be a forced reason to adapt to such improvizations. There is still lot more scope to ethically improve products and even introduce ethical pricing. Keep the ball rolling !!!,santosh
