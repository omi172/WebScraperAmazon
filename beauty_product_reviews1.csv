Episoft Glenmark Episoft Cleansing Lotion For Sensitive&Dry Skin IGentle Cleanser For skin Removes Excess OilIMoisturises And Makes Skin Soft And Glowing I Makeup CleanserIFree Of Sls&Paraben|250Ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the third time I'm buying this product.My dermatologist prescribed it to me while I was on treatment for Acne Vulgaris. Now the treatment is done and dusted but she asked me to continue using it instead of face wash. It doesn't have a foamy texture. It feels more like a lotion but gets the job done. Doesn't rip off all the oil from your face and leaves the face hydrated. Moreover, the product lasts for a long time ( i use it only twice a day) Last time, when I received the product, there was some leakage and it was all over the cardboard box it came in but this time they have sealed it using a tape and it is intact. No more leakage.
The container has a self locking system as well if you turn it the other way.

Episoft Glenmark Episoft Cleansing Lotion For Sensitive&Dry Skin IGentle Cleanser For skin Removes Excess OilIMoisturises And Makes Skin Soft And Glowing I Makeup CleanserIFree Of Sls&Paraben|250Ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,This cleansing lotion has a runny consistency. One needs to apply a small amount on wet skin and massage in soft circular motion for a minute or so. In this way it takes away the layer of excessive oil as well as impurities sitting on top of the skin. Once washed off it unleashes soft and clean skin which does not feel dry at all. One can follow with a light moisturizer and makeup as per their wish. As promised it cleanses gently without dehydrating and being soap free it can be used several times a day.
Episoft Cleansing Lotion is one of the best cleansers for not just sensitive but all skin types. In fact its quite close to Cetaphil cleansing lotion but I find Episoft works better for me. Instantly it helps get rid of accumulated dirt from the pores which otherwise leads to severe breakouts. Similarly it calms down dry and sun sensitive skin but it is not actually very foamy or deep cleansing which might be an issue for oily beauties.Neither does it control oil nor aid in mattifying skin. However, most foamy washes are usually quite hard and strip off natural oils of the skin. Thus I would highly recommend for sensitive as well as irritated skin which needs constant care.

Episoft Glenmark Episoft Cleansing Lotion For Sensitive&Dry Skin IGentle Cleanser For skin Removes Excess OilIMoisturises And Makes Skin Soft And Glowing I Makeup CleanserIFree Of Sls&Paraben|250Ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,You have oily or combination or dry skin, it doesn't matter if you have skin sensitivity. I'm extremely oily acne prone and extremely sensitive so 99% products don't suit my skin. This one comes under that 1% category and I'm glad I found this one out sooner. It's cream based non foaming and you have to take 2 to 3 pumps of products for effectively cleaning your face and have to gently massage it into your face for about 1 to 2 mins especially if you have oily skin. This way this cleanser can remove the oil plugs also and it never broke me out infact it saved my skin. This is my 4th or 5th purchase I think so and I'm gonna use it forever. Everytime I buy 250ml bottle, it lasts me for about 2 months. And it cannot remove any waterproof sunscreen or waterproof makeup. It's a basic gentle cleanser. If you have dry skin then you gonna love it. Give it a try. It would be better if the brand produces the product in 500 lt bottles or even bigger sizes bcz this is my go-to product and I'm never gonna leave it for the rest of my life.

The Derma Co 1% Salicylic Acid Gel Face Wash With Salicylic Acid & Witch Hazel For Active Acne - 100 Ml(Dermaco),5.0 out of 5 stars,The Salicylic Acid Derma Co Face Wash is designed primarily for acne-prone skin and those dealing with excess oil production. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of its effects and a review:

**Effect on Skin:**
1. **Acne Treatment:** Salicylic acid, typically found in concentrations around 0.5% to 2% in such products, helps exfoliate the skin and penetrate pores to clear out debris. This makes it effective in treating acne and preventing future breakouts.

2. **Oil Control:** It can help regulate oil production, which is beneficial for individuals with oily skin types.

3. **Exfoliation:** Salicylic acid is a beta hydroxy acid (BHA) known for its exfoliating properties, aiding in removing dead skin cells and promoting smoother skin texture.

**Review:**
- **Pros:** Users often appreciate its ability to effectively cleanse the skin without over-drying, thanks to its balanced formulation. It tends to leave the skin feeling clean and refreshed.

- **Cons:** Some individuals with sensitive skin may find it too drying or irritating, especially if used too frequently or in high concentrations. It's generally recommended to start with a lower concentration and gradually increase usage if well-tolerated.

**Overall:** The Salicylic Acid Derma Co Face Wash is well-suited for oily and acne-prone skin types seeking an effective cleanser to manage breakouts and excess oil. However, individuals with sensitive skin should approach with caution or consider patch testing first. Always follow up with moisturizer and sunscreen, especially when using products containing salicylic acid. The packaging of the Salicylic Acid Derma Co Face Wash typically consists of a plastic tube or bottle with a flip-cap or pump dispenser. Here‚Äôs what you can generally expect from its packaging:

1. **Container Type:** It often comes in a squeezable tube or a bottle with a dispenser mechanism (such as a flip-cap or pump).

2. **Material:** The packaging is usually made of plastic, which is lightweight and allows easy dispensing of the product.

3. **Size:** It is available in various sizes, typically ranging from 50ml to 150ml, catering to different preferences and usage needs.

4. **Design:** The design is functional and straightforward, often featuring branding details, usage instructions, and ingredient information.

5. **Hygiene Considerations:** The packaging is designed to maintain hygiene by preventing excessive exposure to air and contaminants, which helps preserve the efficacy of the product.

Overall, the packaging of the Salicylic Acid Derma Co Face Wash is practical, ensuring ease of use while maintaining the integrity of the product until it is fully used and its fragrance free a great value of money

,Hii
The Derma Co 1% Salicylic Acid Gel Face Wash With Salicylic Acid & Witch Hazel For Active Acne - 100 Ml(Dermaco),1.0 out of 5 stars,I have never experienced such a disastrous skincare product before, and The Derma Co 1% Salicylic Acid Gel Face Wash With Salicylic Acid & Witch Hazel For Active Acne Face Wash takes the cake for being the worst face wash I have ever used. I bought this product with the hope of achieving clearer and healthier skin, but instead, it has wreaked havoc on my face, causing severe acne and damaging my once-glowing complexion.

Firstly, the ingredients in this face wash seem to be a cocktail of harsh chemicals that irritated my skin from the very first use. Upon application, I felt a burning sensation, which should have been my first warning sign to stop using it immediately. However, I naively thought that this was just my skin getting used to the product and decided to persist for a few more days. Big mistake.

As days passed, my skin became progressively worse. Not only did I experience an onslaught of painful acne, but my face also started to feel dry and tight. I developed dry patches and flakiness, which was entirely uncharacteristic of my skin type. It seemed as though the face wash had stripped away all the natural oils and left my skin defenseless against environmental aggressors.

I continued using this Face Wash in the hope that things would improve over time, but unfortunately, it only worsened the situation. Not only did my acne persist, but it started leaving behind stubborn marks and scars that were impossible to ignore. My complexion looked dull, lifeless, and far from the radiant appearance I had before using this product.

To make matters worse, the product claimed to be suitable for all skin types, which is undoubtedly not the case. I now suspect that this face wash is best suited for those with extremely oily and resilient skin, but for anyone with even slightly sensitive or dry skin, I would strongly advise against using this product.

What infuriates me the most is that I trusted the brand and its claims, but instead, I have been left with damaged skin that will take a long time to repair. I dread facing the mirror each day, seeing the scars and blemishes as a constant reminder of this ill-fated purchase.

In conclusion, The Derma Co Face Wash has been an absolute nightmare for my skin. It has caused me more harm than good, leaving me with severe acne, damaged skin, and shattered confidence. I urge anyone considering this product to exercise extreme caution and perform a patch test before incorporating it into their skincare routine. I, for one, will never go near this face wash again and will be wary of trying any other products from this brand. My quest for a suitable face wash continues, and XYZ Face Wash will forever remain on my blacklist of skincare disasters.

I bought this product with the hope of achieving clearer and healthier skin, but instead, it has wreaked havoc on my face, causing severe acne and damaging my once-glowing complexion.

Firstly, the ingredients in this face wash seem to be a cocktail of harsh chemicals that irritated my skin from the very first use. Upon application, I felt a burning sensation, which should have been my first warning sign to stop using it immediately. However, I naively thought that this was just my skin getting used to the product and decided to persist for a few more days. Big mistake.

As days passed, my skin became progressively worse. Not only did I experience an onslaught of painful acne, but my face also started to feel dry and tight. I developed dry patches and flakiness, which was entirely uncharacteristic of my skin type. It seemed as though the face wash had stripped away all the natural oils and left my skin defenseless against environmental aggressors.

I continued using this Face Wash in the hope that things would improve over time, but unfortunately, it only worsened the situation. Not only did my acne persist, but it started leaving behind stubborn marks and scars that were impossible to ignore. My complexion looked dull, lifeless, and far from the radiant appearance I had before using this product.

To make matters worse, the product claimed to be suitable for all skin types, which is undoubtedly not the case. I now suspect that this face wash is best suited for those with extremely oily and resilient skin, but for anyone with even slightly sensitive or dry skin, I would strongly advise against using this product.

What infuriates me the most is that I trusted the brand and its claims, but instead, I have been left with damaged skin that will take a long time to repair. I dread facing the mirror each day, seeing the scars and blemishes as a constant reminder of this ill-fated purchase.

In conclusion, The Derma Co Face Wash has been an absolute nightmare for my skin. It has caused me more harm than good, leaving me with severe acne, damaged skin, and shattered confidence. I urge anyone considering this product to exercise extreme caution and perform a patch test before incorporating it into their skincare routine. I, for one, will never go near this face wash again and will be wary of trying any other products from this brand. My quest for a suitable face wash continues, and XYZ Face Wash will forever remain on my blacklist of skincare disasters.

The Derma Co 1% Salicylic Acid Gel Face Wash With Salicylic Acid & Witch Hazel For Active Acne - 100 Ml(Dermaco),4.0 out of 5 stars,Have been using this product since months and I have combination skin and it works great in controlling oil production on my face. After months of regular use it also helps in reducing some amount of tanning. Not drastic change. But it does help. I also had comedones on my face (in the T zone area) which are gone after 1 months of using this.

Doesn't foam, if does then a little bit, when applied with water it has the soft texture that calms down the face and it's so refreshing. Has no color to it, it's transparent which is the best part. They say it has no smell but it does have a leafy smell to it but It's ok. Because it works like magic ‚ú® for straight 15days my face was suffering from pimples and lot of oil secretion was going on in my T-Zone, after 2 days of use I saw the drastic change , no new pimple arise and oil secretion stopped completely after 3 days. It's moisturizing highly , go for it .

Simple Kind To Skin Refreshing Face Wash 150 ml | 100% soap-free gentle cleanser for sensitive, dry & oily skin, for women & men,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got a pack of 2 of 150ml each for Rs. 598. We all know Simple Skincare products are ideal for beginners and are sensitive skin friendly but I‚Äôm particularly impressed with their Simple kind to skin refreshing face wash. First of all it comes in a generous size of 150ml that lasts me for about 2 months with daily use twice a day. Secondly, the gel is smooth and granule-free, which is ideal for my oily, acne-prone skin since granules can irritate my skin and worsen breakouts which is why, I prefer gel-based or foam-based face washes for my skin, and this one fits the bill perfectly. It lathers nicely and cleanses effectively without causing irritation. I use it for my morning skincare routine and for double cleansing as well. Strongly Suggested!

Simple Kind To Skin Refreshing Face Wash 150 ml | 100% soap-free gentle cleanser for sensitive, dry & oily skin, for women & men,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for oily skin, redness, and hyper-pigmentation as well as bacterial and fungal acne. Works well with my other skincare products. Not bad price-wise either. A single dot, smaller than a dime, lathers nice and is the perfect amount so it'll last a bit. Does not have a noticeable scent. Definitely recommend wetting face and hands before applying to help with the lather.

I tried Vanicream previously and it gave me closed comedones after a week and has like no actives so it doesn't do anything for skin. CeraVe products are typically not fungal acne safe and I did get some cystic acne (a common complaint) while using their SA cleanser so I'm avoiding that brand. Stumbled cross this Simple Face Gel and I've been using it for about 10 days and haven't really had an issue. No new spots really and the spots on my chin that had been there prior to use seem to be healing nicely.

I really like the feel of it and my face absolutely feels clean after using it. I do a dry oil cleanse before my shower with MCT oil and then wash my face off with this after i get out of the shower.

About a day ago I did notice some white heads on my chin, i was able to pop them easily. I did miss my skincare process for a night and have been wearing sunscreen and masks during the day so I don't know that it had anything to do with the product itself per se but definitely don't skip the moisturizing or your skin might produce more oil to compensate for the cleansing. I was using this morning and night for a bit but found my skin getting a little greasy looking by day's end so limiting to night time use and just cleansing with toner in the AM.

I'm definitely going to keep using this.

Simple Kind To Skin Refreshing Face Wash 150 ml | 100% soap-free gentle cleanser for sensitive, dry & oily skin, for women & men,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for oily skin, redness, and hyper-pigmentation as well as bacterial and fungal acne. Works well with my other skincare products. Not bad price-wise either. A single dot, smaller than a dime, lathers nice and is the perfect amount so it'll last a bit. Does not have a noticeable scent. Definitely recommend wetting face and hands before applying to help with the lather.

I tried Vanicream previously and it gave me closed comedones after a week and has like no actives so it doesn't do anything for skin. CeraVe products are typically not fungal acne safe and I did get some cystic acne (a common complaint) while using their SA cleanser so I'm avoiding that brand. Stumbled cross this Simple Face Gel and I've been using it for about 10 days and haven't really had an issue. No new spots really and the spots on my chin that had been there prior to use seem to be healing nicely.

I really like the feel of it and my face absolutely feels clean after using it. I do a dry oil cleanse before my shower with MCT oil and then wash my face off with this after i get out of the shower.

About a day ago I did notice some white heads on my chin, i was able to pop them easily. I did miss my skincare process for a night and have been wearing sunscreen and masks during the day so I don't know that it had anything to do with the product itself per se but definitely don't skip the moisturizing or your skin might produce more oil to compensate for the cleansing. I was using this morning and night for a bit but found my skin getting a little greasy looking by day's end so limiting to night time use and just cleansing with toner in the AM.

I'm definitely going to keep using this.

Minimalist 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash For Oily Skin | Sulphate free, Anti Acne Face Cleanser With LHA & Zinc For Acne or Pimples | For Women & Men | 100 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Minimalist 2% Salicylic Acid Face Cleanser for a few weeks now, and it's been a game-changer for my oily, acne-prone skin. This cleanser effectively tackles breakouts and excess oil without causing dryness or irritation. The combination of 2% salicylic acid, LHA, and zinc works wonders in clearing out pores and keeping new acne at bay.

The texture is light and lathers well, making my skin feel clean and refreshed after each use. I also appreciate that it's sulphate-free, which means it's gentle enough for daily use without stripping my skin of its natural moisture. The BHA liquid exfoliant quality helps to smooth out my skin texture, giving me a clearer complexion over time.

The 3.4 Fl Oz / 100 ml size is perfect for travel and lasts a long time since a little goes a long way. It's suitable for both men and women, making it a versatile addition to any skincare routine.

Overall, the Minimalist 2% Salicylic Acid Face Cleanser delivers on its promises, making it a must-have for anyone struggling with oily and acne-prone skin. Five stars!

The Derma Co Sali-Cinamide Anti-Acne Face Wash I With 2% Salicylic Acid & 2% Niacinamide I Treats Active Acne & Fades Acne Marks I For Oily & Combination Skin I Power of 2 Actives - 80ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been struggling with acne and oily skin for years, and I've tried countless products, but nothing worked as effectively as The Derma Co 2% Sali-Cinamide Anti-Acne Face Wash. This face wash has truly been a game-changer for me!

What I Love:

Powerful Ingredients: The combination of 2% Salicylic Acid and 2% Niacinamide is a perfect duo. The Salicylic Acid effectively clears out my pores, reducing breakouts, while the Niacinamide helps fade acne marks and improves my skin texture.
Visible Results: Within just a week of using this face wash, I noticed a significant reduction in active acne, and my skin started looking clearer and more even-toned. The stubborn acne marks I've had for months are finally starting to fade!
Gentle Yet Effective: Despite its powerful ingredients, this face wash is surprisingly gentle on my skin. It doesn't leave my face feeling dry or irritated, which is a huge plus for me.
Perfect for Oily/Combination Skin: My skin tends to get oily throughout the day, but this face wash keeps it balanced and shine-free. I also love that it doesn't clog my pores or cause any breakouts.
Value for Money: The 150ml bottle lasts quite a while since a little goes a long way. It's worth every penny for the results it delivers.
Overall Experience:
I've finally found a face wash that not only treats active acne but also helps with the aftermath, like fading those pesky acne marks. If you have oily or combination skin and struggle with acne, I highly recommend giving this product a try. It‚Äôs definitely worth the hype!

Thank you, The Derma Co, for this amazing product! I‚Äôll definitely be repurchasing.

After I recovered from chicken pox, I got a lot of scars. To recover from the scars I used some oils on my oil skin. That triggered my acne. After a few days, I got a lot of acne, that was painful, itchy and unbearable and I bought an anti-acne face wash. I used it daily with anti-acne serum. Finally, that gave unexpected results. Now, I get rid of acne very well. The better showing with a month. For better results use anti-acne face wash and anti-acne serum in your routine.

The Derma Co Sali-Cinamide Anti-Acne Face Wash I With 2% Salicylic Acid & 2% Niacinamide I Treats Active Acne & Fades Acne Marks I For Oily & Combination Skin I Power of 2 Actives - 80ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been struggling with acne and oily skin for years, and I've tried countless products, but nothing worked as effectively as The Derma Co 2% Sali-Cinamide Anti-Acne Face Wash. This face wash has truly been a game-changer for me!

What I Love:

Powerful Ingredients: The combination of 2% Salicylic Acid and 2% Niacinamide is a perfect duo. The Salicylic Acid effectively clears out my pores, reducing breakouts, while the Niacinamide helps fade acne marks and improves my skin texture.
Visible Results: Within just a week of using this face wash, I noticed a significant reduction in active acne, and my skin started looking clearer and more even-toned. The stubborn acne marks I've had for months are finally starting to fade!
Gentle Yet Effective: Despite its powerful ingredients, this face wash is surprisingly gentle on my skin. It doesn't leave my face feeling dry or irritated, which is a huge plus for me.
Perfect for Oily/Combination Skin: My skin tends to get oily throughout the day, but this face wash keeps it balanced and shine-free. I also love that it doesn't clog my pores or cause any breakouts.
Value for Money: The 150ml bottle lasts quite a while since a little goes a long way. It's worth every penny for the results it delivers.
Overall Experience:
I've finally found a face wash that not only treats active acne but also helps with the aftermath, like fading those pesky acne marks. If you have oily or combination skin and struggle with acne, I highly recommend giving this product a try. It‚Äôs definitely worth the hype!

Thank you, The Derma Co, for this amazing product! I‚Äôll definitely be repurchasing.

After I recovered from chicken pox, I got a lot of scars. To recover from the scars I used some oils on my oil skin. That triggered my acne. After a few days, I got a lot of acne, that was painful, itchy and unbearable and I bought an anti-acne face wash. I used it daily with anti-acne serum. Finally, that gave unexpected results. Now, I get rid of acne very well. The better showing with a month. For better results use anti-acne face wash and anti-acne serum in your routine.

Garnier Skin Naturals Bright Complete Vitamin C Face Wash - Vitamin C Face Wash For Brighter and Glowing Skin - Daily Cleanser Suitable For all Skin Types, 150g,5.0 out of 5 stars,During summer in North India, i developed eriptions and very dry and scaly skin on my face. I was using all kinds of stuff but my skin didnt improve.

I started using this face wash (from my wife's) and it made huge difference. Should have started using it earlier. I have oily skin and works good enough. Though i feel it would work even better on a dry face because after washing it leaves a glow on your face.

Garnier Skin Naturals Bright Complete Vitamin C Face Wash - Vitamin C Face Wash For Brighter and Glowing Skin - Daily Cleanser Suitable For all Skin Types, 150g,5.0 out of 5 stars,Product Review: Face Wash

I recently tried out a face wash product and wanted to share my experience with it. Here is my honest review:

Cleansing Power:
The primary function of a face wash is to cleanse the skin, and this product did an excellent job in that regard. It effectively removed dirt, oil, and impurities from my skin, leaving it feeling fresh and clean. It lathered well and provided a thorough cleanse without stripping away natural oils.

Gentleness:
One of the essential factors for me when choosing a face wash is its gentleness on the skin. I was pleased to find that this product was gentle and didn't cause any irritation or dryness. It was suitable for my sensitive skin and didn't leave any tight or uncomfortable feeling after use.

Skin Type Compatibility:
This face wash is suitable for a wide range of skin types. Whether you have oily, dry, combination, or sensitive skin, this product is designed to work effectively without causing any adverse reactions. However, it's always recommended to do a patch test before using any new product on your face.

Ingredients:
I appreciated that this face wash contained natural and skin-friendly ingredients. It was free from harsh chemicals, sulfates, and parabens, making it a safer option for daily use. The presence of nourishing ingredients like aloe vera, tea tree oil, or vitamin E added a soothing and refreshing element to the cleansing process.

Scent:
The face wash had a pleasant and subtle scent. It was not overpowering and didn't linger on the skin for too long. The mild fragrance added a refreshing touch to the overall cleansing experience.

Packaging:
The packaging of this face wash was practical and user-friendly. The bottle had a secure cap that prevented any leakage or spillage. The size was convenient for both home use and travel, making it easy to take along on trips.

Overall, I was highly satisfied with this face wash. It effectively cleansed my skin without causing any irritation or dryness. The gentle formula and natural ingredients made it suitable for various skin types. The pleasant scent and practical packaging were additional bonuses. Considering its effectiveness and compatibility with my skin, I believe this product offers good value for money.

I would recommend this face wash to anyone in need of a gentle yet effective cleanser. Remember to follow up with a suitable moisturizer for optimal skincare routine.

Cetaphil Face Wash by Cetaphil, Gentle Skin Cleanser for Dry to Normal, Sensitive Skin - 250 ml| Hydrating Face Wash with Niacinamide,Vitamin B5| Dermatologist Recommended| Paraben, Sulphate Free,3.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money if you are buying it as facewash.....First of all it not a facewash....it is a face cleanser which gentlely Cleans the skin without use of water.
It doesn't makes any foam like facewash. Use this product only when you have very sensitive Skin which generally can't tolerate the normal facewash available in the market.
But Don't get trapped if you have oily and combination and normal skin type. It may worsen the condition if you have acne prone and oily skin type. It always advisable to use salicylic acid based facewash if you have acne prone and oily skin type.

But to be cautious that it is not suitable for a moderately oily skin.
So can't buy it again due to that experience.
Pretty sure it will be good for heavily oily skin.

Himalaya Herbals Purifying Neem Face Wash, 150ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,I absolutely love this product!
It is a great facial cleanser and rinses squeaky clean yet doesn‚Äôt feel drying or tingly.
It‚Äôs also the best thing I‚Äôve found to cleanse the skin around my stoma before applying an ostomy bag and I have recommended it to other ‚ÄòOstomates‚Äô in a Facebook group.
A word of caution: A little goes a LONG way. It takes about a drop half the size of a pea to wash my face and neck. When I first used it I squeezed out what seemed like an appropriate amount and it almost felt oily and took a long time to rinse clean.
This cleanser isn‚Äôt very thick and it took a few uses to get the hang of dispensing such a small amount.
It‚Äôs not overly fragrant which is great for me. I‚Äôm very sensitive to some chemical fragrances (perfume causes vomiting and respiratory distress), and this has a faint soapy smell.
Great stuff!

Mamaearth Rice Face Wash With Rice Water & Niacinamide For Glass Skin - 100 Ml,2.0 out of 5 stars,I had high hopes for Mamaearth's Rice Water Face Wash due to its promising ingredients like niacinamide and rice water. However, my experience with this product left much to be desired.

While some users praised its ability to achieve a "glass skin" effect, it's essential to highlight potential drawbacks. The formula, while initially hydrating, tends to strip the skin of natural oils, leading to dryness, tightness, and itching. This could be problematic, especially for those with dry or sensitive skin.

Despite its pleasant fragrance, a face wash's primary purpose should be effective cleansing without compromising skin health. Unfortunately, Mamaearth's Rice Water Face Wash falls short in this regard.

It's concerning that, despite positive reviews, me as well as my sister and friend, experienced adverse effects like increased dryness and acne breakouts. This suggests inconsistency in the product's performance and indicates it may not be suitable for all skin types.

In conclusion, while Mamaearth Rice Water Face Wash may provide temporary radiance and freshness, its potential to cause dryness and discomfort outweighs its benefits. I recommend exploring alternative options that prioritize skin health and balance.

The Derma Co Sali-Cinamide Anti-Acne Face Wash I With 2% Salicylic Acid & 2% Niacinamide I Treats Active Acne & Fades Acne Marks I For Oily & Combination Skin I Power of 2 Actives - 80ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been struggling with acne and oily skin for years, and I've tried countless products, but nothing worked as effectively as The Derma Co 2% Sali-Cinamide Anti-Acne Face Wash. This face wash has truly been a game-changer for me!

What I Love:

Powerful Ingredients: The combination of 2% Salicylic Acid and 2% Niacinamide is a perfect duo. The Salicylic Acid effectively clears out my pores, reducing breakouts, while the Niacinamide helps fade acne marks and improves my skin texture.
Visible Results: Within just a week of using this face wash, I noticed a significant reduction in active acne, and my skin started looking clearer and more even-toned. The stubborn acne marks I've had for months are finally starting to fade!
Gentle Yet Effective: Despite its powerful ingredients, this face wash is surprisingly gentle on my skin. It doesn't leave my face feeling dry or irritated, which is a huge plus for me.
Perfect for Oily/Combination Skin: My skin tends to get oily throughout the day, but this face wash keeps it balanced and shine-free. I also love that it doesn't clog my pores or cause any breakouts.
Value for Money: The 150ml bottle lasts quite a while since a little goes a long way. It's worth every penny for the results it delivers.
Overall Experience:
I've finally found a face wash that not only treats active acne but also helps with the aftermath, like fading those pesky acne marks. If you have oily or combination skin and struggle with acne, I highly recommend giving this product a try. It‚Äôs definitely worth the hype!

Thank you, The Derma Co, for this amazing product! I‚Äôll definitely be repurchasing.

After a few days, I got a lot of acne, that was painful, itchy and unbearable and I bought an anti-acne face wash. I used it daily with anti-acne serum. Finally, that gave unexpected results. Now, I get rid of acne very well. The better showing with a month. For better results use anti-acne face wash and anti-acne serum in your routine.

The Derma Co 1% Salicylic Acid Gel Face Wash With Salicylic Acid & Witch Hazel For Active Acne - 100 Ml(Dermaco),5.0 out of 5 stars,The Salicylic Acid Derma Co Face Wash is designed primarily for acne-prone skin and those dealing with excess oil production. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of its effects and a review:

**Effect on Skin:**
1. **Acne Treatment:** Salicylic acid, typically found in concentrations around 0.5% to 2% in such products, helps exfoliate the skin and penetrate pores to clear out debris. This makes it effective in treating acne and preventing future breakouts.

2. **Oil Control:** It can help regulate oil production, which is beneficial for individuals with oily skin types.

3. **Exfoliation:** Salicylic acid is a beta hydroxy acid (BHA) known for its exfoliating properties, aiding in removing dead skin cells and promoting smoother skin texture.

**Review:**
- **Pros:** Users often appreciate its ability to effectively cleanse the skin without over-drying, thanks to its balanced formulation. It tends to leave the skin feeling clean and refreshed.

- **Cons:** Some individuals with sensitive skin may find it too drying or irritating, especially if used too frequently or in high concentrations. It's generally recommended to start with a lower concentration and gradually increase usage if well-tolerated.

**Overall:** The Salicylic Acid Derma Co Face Wash is well-suited for oily and acne-prone skin types seeking an effective cleanser to manage breakouts and excess oil. However, individuals with sensitive skin should approach with caution or consider patch testing first. Always follow up with moisturizer and sunscreen, especially when using products containing salicylic acid. The packaging of the Salicylic Acid Derma Co Face Wash typically consists of a plastic tube or bottle with a flip-cap or pump dispenser. Here‚Äôs what you can generally expect from its packaging:

1. **Container Type:** It often comes in a squeezable tube or a bottle with a dispenser mechanism (such as a flip-cap or pump).

2. **Material:** The packaging is usually made of plastic, which is lightweight and allows easy dispensing of the product.

3. **Size:** It is available in various sizes, typically ranging from 50ml to 150ml, catering to different preferences and usage needs.

4. **Design:** The design is functional and straightforward, often featuring branding details, usage instructions, and ingredient information.

5. **Hygiene Considerations:** The packaging is designed to maintain hygiene by preventing excessive exposure to air and contaminants, which helps preserve the efficacy of the product.

Overall, the packaging of the Salicylic Acid Derma Co Face Wash is practical, ensuring ease of use while maintaining the integrity of the product until it is fully used and its fragrance free a great value of money

The Derma Co 1% Salicylic Acid Gel Face Wash With Salicylic Acid & Witch Hazel For Active Acne - 100 Ml(Dermaco),5.0 out of 5 stars,Good texture, works best on sensitive skin
,Hii
The Derma Co 1% Salicylic Acid Gel Face Wash With Salicylic Acid & Witch Hazel For Active Acne - 100 Ml(Dermaco),1.0 out of 5 stars,I have never experienced such a disastrous skincare product before, and The Derma Co 1% Salicylic Acid Gel Face Wash With Salicylic Acid & Witch Hazel For Active Acne Face Wash takes the cake for being the worst face wash I have ever used. I bought this product with the hope of achieving clearer and healthier skin, but instead, it has wreaked havoc on my face, causing severe acne and damaging my once-glowing complexion.

Firstly, the ingredients in this face wash seem to be a cocktail of harsh chemicals that irritated my skin from the very first use. Upon application, I felt a burning sensation, which should have been my first warning sign to stop using it immediately. However, I naively thought that this was just my skin getting used to the product and decided to persist for a few more days. Big mistake.

As days passed, my skin became progressively worse. Not only did I experience an onslaught of painful acne, but my face also started to feel dry and tight. I developed dry patches and flakiness, which was entirely uncharacteristic of my skin type. It seemed as though the face wash had stripped away all the natural oils and left my skin defenseless against environmental aggressors.

I continued using this Face Wash in the hope that things would improve over time, but unfortunately, it only worsened the situation. Not only did my acne persist, but it started leaving behind stubborn marks and scars that were impossible to ignore. My complexion looked dull, lifeless, and far from the radiant appearance I had before using this product.

To make matters worse, the product claimed to be suitable for all skin types, which is undoubtedly not the case. I now suspect that this face wash is best suited for those with extremely oily and resilient skin, but for anyone with even slightly sensitive or dry skin, I would strongly advise against using this product.

What infuriates me the most is that I trusted the brand and its claims, but instead, I have been left with damaged skin that will take a long time to repair. I dread facing the mirror each day, seeing the scars and blemishes as a constant reminder of this ill-fated purchase.

In conclusion, The Derma Co Face Wash has been an absolute nightmare for my skin. It has caused me more harm than good, leaving me with severe acne, damaged skin, and shattered confidence. I urge anyone considering this product to exercise extreme caution and perform a patch test before incorporating it into their skincare routine. I, for one, will never go near this face wash again and will be wary of trying any other products from this brand. My quest for a suitable face wash continues, and XYZ Face Wash will forever remain on my blacklist of skincare disasters.

It seemed as though the face wash had stripped away all the natural oils and left my skin defenseless against environmental aggressors.

I continued using this Face Wash in the hope that things would improve over time, but unfortunately, it only worsened the situation. Not only did my acne persist, but it started leaving behind stubborn marks and scars that were impossible to ignore. My complexion looked dull, lifeless, and far from the radiant appearance I had before using this product.

To make matters worse, the product claimed to be suitable for all skin types, which is undoubtedly not the case. I now suspect that this face wash is best suited for those with extremely oily and resilient skin, but for anyone with even slightly sensitive or dry skin, I would strongly advise against using this product.

What infuriates me the most is that I trusted the brand and its claims, but instead, I have been left with damaged skin that will take a long time to repair. I dread facing the mirror each day, seeing the scars and blemishes as a constant reminder of this ill-fated purchase.

In conclusion, The Derma Co Face Wash has been an absolute nightmare for my skin. It has caused me more harm than good, leaving me with severe acne, damaged skin, and shattered confidence. I urge anyone considering this product to exercise extreme caution and perform a patch test before incorporating it into their skincare routine. I, for one, will never go near this face wash again and will be wary of trying any other products from this brand. My quest for a suitable face wash continues, and XYZ Face Wash will forever remain on my blacklist of skincare disasters.

The Derma Co 1% Salicylic Acid Gel Face Wash With Salicylic Acid & Witch Hazel For Active Acne - 100 Ml(Dermaco),4.0 out of 5 stars,Have been using this product since months and I have combination skin and it works great in controlling oil production on my face. After months of regular use it also helps in reducing some amount of tanning. Not drastic change. But it does help. I also had comedones on my face (in the T zone area) which are gone after 1 months of using this.

Mamaearth Ubtan Natural Face Wash for All Skin Type with Turmeric & Saffron for Tan removal and Skin brightning 100 ml - SLS & Paraben Free,4.0 out of 5 stars,I recently tried the Mamaearth Ubtan Natural Face Wash for All Skin Types with Turmeric & Saffron, and I must say it has been a refreshing addition to my skincare routine. This face wash not only promises to remove tan but also claims to brighten the skin, making it suitable for a wide range of skin types.

One of the standout features of this face wash is its natural formulation. It is free from harsh chemicals like SLS and parabens, which is a big plus for those with sensitive skin. I appreciate that Mamaearth focuses on using natural ingredients that are gentle yet effective.

The combination of turmeric and saffron in this face wash is fantastic. Turmeric is known for its anti-inflammatory and healing properties, while saffron is known for its skin-brightening abilities. Together, they create a powerful blend that targets tan removal and promotes a brighter complexion.

Upon using the face wash, I noticed its pleasant fragrance, which is not overpowering. The consistency is creamy and smooth, and a small amount goes a long way. It lathers up well and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. It doesn't strip away natural oils from the skin, which is a common issue with some face washes.

I have combination skin, and this face wash has worked well for me. It effectively removes dirt, excess oil, and impurities, leaving my skin feeling clean and balanced. I also noticed a subtle improvement in my skin's texture and brightness after regular use. While it may not deliver dramatic results overnight, with consistent use, it does contribute to a more radiant complexion.

Another great aspect of this product is Mama Earth's commitment to being environmentally friendly. The packaging is recyclable, and the brand is known for its sustainable practices. It's reassuring to know that I'm using a product that not only benefits my skin but also takes steps towards a greener planet.

However, it's worth noting that individual results may vary depending on various factors such as skin type and sensitivity. Some users may experience a mild tingling sensation due to the natural ingredients, but it should subside quickly.

In conclusion, the Mamaearth Ubtan Natural Face Wash is a refreshing and effective option for those looking to remove tan and brighten their skin. With its natural formulation, delightful fragrance, and the power of turmeric and saffron, it delivers on its promises.

Ethiglo Skin Whitening Face Wash 200Ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,Skin specialist MBBS doctor recommended me this facewash. It clears oil from face completely because of important ingredient Salicylic acid. Feels fresh. Nice light fragrance. It gives light brightness on face for short time when you wash face. You can use 3 to 4 times who has oily skin. Just small 2-3 drops are enough to clean face. It create lot of foam.Not recommended for dry skin. Check with skin doctor before purchase.

DERMATOUCH Bright & Even Tone Face Wash with Niacinamide, Vitamin E and Kojic Acid | Daily Gentle Face Cleanser For Tan, Pigmentation, Uneven Tone, Dark Spot Removal - 70G,3.0 out of 5 stars,I recently got my hands on this face wash and have been using it for the past 2 to 3 days where is my quick review and first impressions. The packaging is travel friendly and I appreciate that the ingredients list is detailed and transparent.

The texture of the face wash is milky & liquidy, creating a very good lather during use. After washing my face, I did notice an initial brightening effect, which unfortunately turned out to be temporary. In my case. How about my experience with this face wash has been mixed, leaning towards a disappointment.!

As someone with combination skin, I found this face wash to be extremely drying on my skin. If you have dry skin I suggest avoiding it all together as it may exacerbate dryness and discomfort. On a positive note, I didn‚Äôt experience any irritation of break out which is always relief when trying new skin care products.

Overall, I would consider this to be an okay product for me personally. While it showed promising the initial brightness, effect and lack of irritation, the extreme drying aspect overshadows its benefits regrettably this will be a one-time buy for me as I need a face wash that can better cater to my combination skin need

DERMATOUCH Bright & Even Tone Face Wash with Niacinamide, Vitamin E and Kojic Acid | Daily Gentle Face Cleanser For Tan, Pigmentation, Uneven Tone, Dark Spot Removal - 70G,3.0 out of 5 stars,I recently got my hands on this face wash and have been using it for the past 2 to 3 days where is my quick review and first impressions. The packaging is travel friendly and I appreciate that the ingredients list is detailed and transparent.

The texture of the face wash is milky & liquidy, creating a very good lather during use. After washing my face, I did notice an initial brightening effect, which unfortunately turned out to be temporary. In my case. How about my experience with this face wash has been mixed, leaning towards a disappointment.!

As someone with combination skin, I found this face wash to be extremely drying on my skin. If you have dry skin I suggest avoiding it all together as it may exacerbate dryness and discomfort. On a positive note, I didn‚Äôt experience any irritation of break out which is always relief when trying new skin care products.

Overall, I would consider this to be an okay product for me personally. While it showed promising the initial brightness, effect and lack of irritation, the extreme drying aspect overshadows its benefits regrettably this will be a one-time buy for me as I need a face wash that can better cater to my combination skin need

Clean & Clear Foaming Face Wash For Oily Skin, 150ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,A little harsh on the skin but that's the reason it cleans so well. Gentle facewashes are not meant for oily skin as we produce much more sebum than normal skin types.

Nivea Men Face Wash, Oil Control For 12Hr Oil Control With 10X Vitamin C Effect, 150 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Nivea Men Face Wash with Oil Control for 7 days, and I am extremely pleased with the results. This face wash, featuring a potent 10X Vitamin C effect, effectively manages oil production throughout the day. After each use, my skin feels refreshingly clean but there is a dryness which can be easily balanced by applying moisturizer. The formula is gentle yet powerful, making it perfect for daily use. The 150 ml size is convenient and long-lasting. Additionally, it has significantly reduced my acne and blemishes, leaving my skin clearer and more evenly toned. I highly recommend this product to anyone dealing with oily skin.

Here are some recommendations for face wash from other brands.

1. La Roche-Posay Effaclar Purifying Foaming Gel
2. CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser
3. Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash
4. Kiehl‚Äôs Ultra Facial Oil-Free Cleanser

Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash | Deep Cleansing Face Wash with Salicylic Acid | Hydrating, Alcohol Free, Non Comedogenic & Dermatologically Tested | For Oily Acne Prone Skin | 175ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,After using a lot of other brands facewash when I found this my research was over. I used to have a new pimple every week because of my pcod problem and ever since I've been using this I don't get any new pimples anymore. The scars of old ones are left and that too are healing gradually. As for my skin texture, I don't feel like I have dry skin and not that oily either. If you don't possess sensitive skin just GO. FOR. IT. And all the pcod/pcos girlies, this is ASTOUNDING.

Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash | Deep Cleansing Face Wash with Salicylic Acid | Hydrating, Alcohol Free, Non Comedogenic & Dermatologically Tested | For Oily Acne Prone Skin | 175ml,1.0 out of 5 stars,I have only used the product twice on my face. While washing, I also lathered the product around my hands a bit. You can see the result on my hands clearly in the picture and you can well imagine what the product did to my face. I'm having numerous tiny cystic breakouts all over my face. Worst part is that they sting pretty bad. They are itchy and painful as if rubbing lemon on bare face. Skin feels dry, patchy, and rough as if it is dead. When I rub my fingers on my face, I can feel the tiny bumps on my face. My lips also feel burnt. The upper lip area is on fire 24/7. I don't know how are they selling this horrible conc. Acid at a commercial level. I'm literally planning to through away the entire bottle. 560 Rs went in drain! Worst thing I've ever bought in life. This product deserves no stars. Not even one. It's that bad!!
IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT NO MATTER WHAT. It's literally like rubbing concentrated acid on your face.
Idk how long will it take for my skin to heal. Really frustrated n disappointed with this product.

Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash | Deep Cleansing Face Wash with Salicylic Acid | Hydrating, Alcohol Free, Non Comedogenic & Dermatologically Tested | For Oily Acne Prone Skin | 175ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is cut above a lot of other products. Very affordable and reliable acne cleanser. I have a super oily face very prone to pimple breakouts.
After trying so many different products, this is THE product that helps in keeping my acne in check. I had wasted money and sadly have tossed other left over products after trying.
After about 3 months I've settled for 'Neutragena oil-free acne wash' as my daily facewash.

TIP: Apply to palm and make lather first before applying to face. Twice or 3 times a day does the trick for me.
Works best with a good non-comedogenic/water based moisturiser (as any deep cleanser, this will dry your skin).Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash 175mL

This facewash is truly a game-changer when it comes to skincare.

Firstly, the scent of this facewash is absolutely delightful. The combination of apple and cherry gives it a refreshing and fruity aroma that instantly uplifts my mood every time I use it. It's like a burst of freshness on my face!

The texture of the facewash is also very smooth and gentle on the skin. It lathers up beautifully and feels incredibly soft while cleansing. I appreciate how it effectively removes dirt, oil, and impurities without leaving my skin feeling dry or stripped. Instead, it leaves my skin feeling refreshed, hydrated, and nourished.

One of the standout features of this facewash is its ability to brighten and even out my skin tone. The combination of apple and cherry extracts works wonders in enhancing my complexion and giving it a healthy glow. It has definitely helped in reducing dullness and making my skin appear more radiant.

After a lot of research, I narrowed it down to this combo and....

I am truly very satisfied. Does a fantastic job.

Pos:
1. Instantly brightens the face
2. Non drying( I have a mature skin type)
3. No bad and weird ingredients
4. 2-3 drops is enough to cleanse the face and neck

Neg:
1. Smell- a bit of off-putting; Having said that - don't smell the bottle, just put a few drops on your palms and rub it on the face

This one is likely to be my go to cleanser purchase going forward.üíï

Minimalist 7% ALA & AHA Brightening Face Wash with Vitamin B5 For Hydration, Glycolic Acid For Exfoliation & Alpha Lipoic Acid For Glowing Skin | For Men & Women | 100 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently incorporated this face wash into my skincare routine, and let me tell you, it's a game-changer.

Formulated with Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA) and Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA), this face wash works wonders in gently exfoliating the skin, revealing a brighter and more even-toned complexion over time.

The addition of Vitamin B5 ensures that your skin stays hydrated and nourished, preventing any dryness or irritation that can sometimes occur with exfoliating products.

I love how this face wash effortlessly removes impurities and dead skin cells, leaving my skin feeling refreshed and rejuvenated after each use. The gentle yet effective formula makes it suitable for daily use, making it a staple in my skincare routine.

The minimalist approach to ingredients is another plus point for me. With no unnecessary fillers or fragrances, I can trust that I'm giving my skin only the best.

Overall, if you're looking to achieve a radiant and glowing complexion, look no further than Minimalist 7% ALA & AHA Face Wash. Say hello to your best skin yet!

Lotus Herbals Whiteglow 3 In 1 Deep Cleaning Skin Whitening Facial Foam | Chemical Free | With Milk Enzymes & Aloe Vera Gel | For All Skin Types | 100g,5.0 out of 5 stars,It really make my skin so soft and bright !!
,Kumar Gaurav
Lotus Herbals Whiteglow 3 In 1 Deep Cleaning Skin Whitening Facial Foam | Chemical Free | With Milk Enzymes & Aloe Vera Gel | For All Skin Types | 100g,4.0 out of 5 stars,I recently tried the Lotus Herbals WhiteGlow 3-In-1 Deep Cleansing Skin Whitening Facial Foam, and I must say it has become a staple in my skincare routine. This face wash claims to offer not only deep cleansing but also skin whitening benefits, making it an attractive option for those looking to achieve a brighter complexion.

Firstly, the packaging is simple yet effective, with a flip-top cap that prevents spillage and makes it convenient to use. The consistency of the facial foam is creamy and lathers up beautifully, creating a luxurious foam that feels gentle on the skin.

As a deep cleanser, it effectively removes dirt, excess oil, and impurities without leaving the skin feeling dry or stripped. It has a refreshing fragrance that is not too overpowering, making the cleansing process even more enjoyable.

One of the main selling points of this product is its skin whitening claims. While I did notice a slight improvement in my skin tone after regular use, I believe the term "whitening" here refers to brightening and achieving a more even complexion rather than altering the skin's actual color.

I have sensitive skin, and I was pleased to find that this facial foam didn't cause any irritation or breakouts. It contains ingredients like licorice and green tea extracts, known for their skin-soothing and antioxidant properties, which could explain the gentle nature of this product.

One small drawback I noticed is that it may not be the most effective at removing heavy makeup. It's more suitable for daily cleansing and not as a makeup remover.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Lotus Herbals WhiteGlow 3-In-1 Deep Cleansing Skin Whitening Facial Foam for anyone looking for a gentle yet effective daily face wash. It's particularly suitable for those with normal to oily skin types and may help improve skin tone and texture over time. However, if makeup removal is your primary concern, you might need to pair it with a dedicated makeup remover before using this facial foam for the best results.

The face wash has a creamy texture and a mild fragrance. It lathers well and cleanses the skin thoroughly. It removes dirt, oil, and makeup without drying the skin. The face wash contains natural ingredients like milk enzymes and aloe vera gel that help to whiten the skin and reduce dark spots. The face wash also improves the skin texture and makes it soft and smooth. The face wash is suitable for all skin types and does not cause any irritation or allergy. The face wash comes in a convenient tube packaging that is easy to use and carry. The face wash is affordable and easily available online and offline. I would recommend this face wash to anyone who wants a natural and effective skin whitening product.

However, if makeup removal is your primary concern, you might need to pair it with a dedicated makeup remover before using this facial foam for the best results.

Himalaya Moisturizing Aloe Vera Face Wash, 200ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Himalaya Moisturizing Aloe Vera Face Wash is a gentle and refreshing daily face cleanser that stands out for its soothing properties, thanks to its key ingredient, aloe vera. Here's a breakdown as follows:

Pros:
1. Hydrating Formula: The aloe vera in the formula helps retain skin moisture, making it perfect for dry to combination skin types. After use, the skin feels soft and hydrated rather than tight or dry.
2. Mild and Gentle: This face wash is gentle on the skin, free from harsh chemicals, and suitable for sensitive skin. It cleanses without stripping away natural oils.
3. Natural Ingredients: In addition to aloe vera, it contains cucumber, which helps to cool and soothe the skin, giving a refreshed feeling after each wash.
4. Affordable & Easily Accessible: It's reasonably priced for a 200ml bottle, and being a Himalaya product, it's widely available both online and in stores.
5. Non-Comedogenic: It doesn't clog pores, so it‚Äôs a good choice for people with acne-prone skin.

Cons:

1. Mild Cleansing Power: While it‚Äôs great for light daily use, those with oily or heavily makeup-laden skin might find it insufficient for deep cleansing.
2. Fragrance: Although pleasant, the scent might be a bit strong for those who prefer fragrance-free skincare.

Finally: Overall, Himalaya Moisturizing Aloe Vera Face Wash is a great, affordable choice for people seeking a gentle, hydrating, and natural facial cleanser. It works best for dry and sensitive skin types, but may not be as effective for very oily or heavily soiled skin.

Estava bem pior que a primeira foto. Uso o produto 1x ao dia, no √∫ltimo banho, antes de dormir, espero uns 3/4 min enxaguo bem e pronto. N√£o uso nada nas axilas depois disso s√≥ no dia seguinte. No in√≠cio n√£o levei muita f√©. Por√©m eu n√£o tinha muita escolha, j√° havia comprado. E com 21 dias j√° t√¥ feliz com o meu resultado.

Bioderma Pigmentbio Foaming Cream Brightening Exfoliating Cleanser (Face & Body Wash) For Brightened Skin, 200 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently discovered the Bioderma Pigmentbio Foaming Face Cream, and I must say, it has become a game-changer in my skincare routine. This product deserves a solid 5-star rating for its illuminating and hydrating properties, as well as its effectiveness in addressing visible dark spots.

First and foremost, this face cream's ability to gently cleanse and purify the skin is remarkable. The foam texture feels luxurious and indulgent, transforming my daily skincare routine into a spa-like experience. The cream effectively removes impurities, excess oil, and makeup without stripping the skin of its natural moisture, leaving it feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.

What sets this face cream apart is its unique formulation designed specifically for skin prone to visible dark spots. The illuminating properties of the cream work to even out skin tone and reduce the appearance of hyperpigmentation. With continued use, I have noticed a significant improvement in the overall clarity and brightness of my skin. The cream's ability to target and fade dark spots is truly impressive.

In addition to its brightening effects, this face cream is also incredibly hydrating. It replenishes moisture and leaves my skin feeling supple and plump. The lightweight formula absorbs quickly into the skin, without any greasy or sticky residue. I appreciate how it provides a perfect balance of hydration, making it suitable for various skin types, including combination and sensitive skin.

Another aspect worth mentioning is the gentle exfoliation this cream provides. The exfoliating properties help to remove dead skin cells, allowing for better absorption of subsequent skincare products. This not only enhances the effectiveness of the cream but also promotes a smoother and more refined complexion over time.

As with all Bioderma products, the Pigmentbio Foaming Face Cream is dermatologically tested and formulated with utmost care. It is hypoallergenic, non-comedogenic, and free from harmful ingredients. This reassures me that I am using a product that prioritizes skin health and safety.

In conclusion, the Bioderma Pigmentbio Foaming Face Cream is a standout cleanser that delivers on its promises. Its illuminating and hydrating properties, along with its ability to target visible dark spots, make it an excellent addition to any skincare routine. If you're looking to achieve a brighter, more even complexion, I highly recommend giving this face cream a try. It truly deserves a solid 5-star rating.

Ahaglow Advanced Face Wash Gel, Daily Gentle Cleansing Formula For Normal And Oily Skin, 100 G,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently tried an exfoliating facewash gel that left a positive impression. The product effectively cleansed my skin, leaving it feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. It has a pleasant scent that adds to the overall experience. The gel's texture was easy to apply and lather, making it simple to incorporate into my skincare routine. After regular use, I noticed a smoother and brighter complexion, which was a pleasant surprise. If you're looking for a skincare product to help improve your skin's texture and appearance, this might be worth considering.

Neutrogena Deep Clean Gentle Facial Cleanser | 2x Glycerin & Cleansing Agent | Alcohol-Free | Dermatologist Tested | Normal to Oily Skin | For Men and Women | 200ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently added the Neutrogena Deep Clean Facial Cleanser to my skincare routine, and it has quickly become a favorite. Tailored for normal to oily skin, this cleanser delivers on its promises with remarkable results.

The gel formula feels incredibly refreshing on the skin, providing a deep cleanse that removes impurities and excess oil without over-drying. The 200ml size is generous, and a little goes a long way, making it an economical choice for a daily cleanser.

One of the standout features is the invigorating sensation it leaves after use. It's like a burst of freshness that wakes up my skin, leaving it feeling revitalized and thoroughly cleansed. The formula is non-comedogenic, which is a big win for those with sensitive or acne-prone skin.

I've noticed a visible improvement in the overall texture of my skin since incorporating this cleanser into my routine. It effectively tackles stubborn blackheads and leaves my complexion looking clearer and more radiant.

Neutrogena Deep Clean Gentle Facial Cleanser | 2x Glycerin & Cleansing Agent | Alcohol-Free | Dermatologist Tested | Normal to Oily Skin | For Men and Women | 200ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,After using many products available, I have finally found the best pair of products for oily skin.

Packaging: All three products came nicely and securely packed. The bottles are also designed for convenience as the push drop bottle produces the appropriate amount of face wash and moisturizer and even the suncream has a small opening to eject the appropriate amount of cream.

Product:
a. Facewash: The face wash is nice and light. It creates a good amount of foam and removes almost all the dirt and oil from the face leaving the face moist and clear. The face wash has a mild rose fragrance but does not irritate the nose. The face wash used twice a day lasts for 30 Days.

b. Moisturizer: The moisturizer is the star product of the pack. It is very light and easily applies to the skin. It leaves the skin oil-free moist and healthy feeling all day long. The best part is the moisturizer does leave an oily dark face. The moisturizer used twice a day lasts for 2 months. (I use only one pump every time)

c. Suncream: Suncream is also amazing and lightweight. It applies really well to the face and unlike many creams in the market, it also does not leave a dark oily looking face. The Suncream used twice a day lasts for 2 months (I use only a peanut-sized cream every time)

Price: The price range is also fine with all the three items coming in just Rs. 719, the make a great deal.

Although this month I am trying Cipla Saslic Ds Foaming Face Wash 60 ml (Pack of 2), from LifeLine Medicos as a face wash and Neutrogena's Moisturizer and suncream.

Neutrogena Deep Clean Gentle Facial Cleanser | 2x Glycerin & Cleansing Agent | Alcohol-Free | Dermatologist Tested | Normal to Oily Skin | For Men and Women | 200ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently added the Neutrogena Deep Clean Facial Cleanser to my skincare routine, and it has quickly become a favorite. Tailored for normal to oily skin, this cleanser delivers on its promises with remarkable results.

The gel formula feels incredibly refreshing on the skin, providing a deep cleanse that removes impurities and excess oil without over-drying. The 200ml size is generous, and a little goes a long way, making it an economical choice for a daily cleanser.

One of the standout features is the invigorating sensation it leaves after use. It's like a burst of freshness that wakes up my skin, leaving it feeling revitalized and thoroughly cleansed. The formula is non-comedogenic, which is a big win for those with sensitive or acne-prone skin.

I've noticed a visible improvement in the overall texture of my skin since incorporating this cleanser into my routine. It effectively tackles stubborn blackheads and leaves my complexion looking clearer and more radiant.

Neutrogena Deep Clean Gentle Facial Cleanser | 2x Glycerin & Cleansing Agent | Alcohol-Free | Dermatologist Tested | Normal to Oily Skin | For Men and Women | 200ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,After using many products available, I have finally found the best pair of products for oily skin.

Packaging: All three products came nicely and securely packed. The bottles are also designed for convenience as the push drop bottle produces the appropriate amount of face wash and moisturizer and even the suncream has a small opening to eject the appropriate amount of cream.

Product:
a. Facewash: The face wash is nice and light. It creates a good amount of foam and removes almost all the dirt and oil from the face leaving the face moist and clear. The face wash has a mild rose fragrance but does not irritate the nose. The face wash used twice a day lasts for 30 Days.

b. Moisturizer: The moisturizer is the star product of the pack. It is very light and easily applies to the skin. It leaves the skin oil-free moist and healthy feeling all day long. The best part is the moisturizer does leave an oily dark face. The moisturizer used twice a day lasts for 2 months. (I use only one pump every time)

c. Suncream: Suncream is also amazing and lightweight. It applies really well to the face and unlike many creams in the market, it also does not leave a dark oily looking face. The Suncream used twice a day lasts for 2 months (I use only a peanut-sized cream every time)

Price: The price range is also fine with all the three items coming in just Rs. 719, the make a great deal.

Mamaearth Ubtan Natural Face Wash For all Skin Type with Turmeric & Saffron for Tan Removal ‚Äì 150 ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,I recently tried the Mamaearth Ubtan Natural Face Wash for All Skin Types with Turmeric & Saffron, and I must say it has been a refreshing addition to my skincare routine. This face wash not only promises to remove tan but also claims to brighten the skin, making it suitable for a wide range of skin types.

One of the standout features of this face wash is its natural formulation. It is free from harsh chemicals like SLS and parabens, which is a big plus for those with sensitive skin. I appreciate that Mamaearth focuses on using natural ingredients that are gentle yet effective.

The combination of turmeric and saffron in this face wash is fantastic. Turmeric is known for its anti-inflammatory and healing properties, while saffron is known for its skin-brightening abilities. Together, they create a powerful blend that targets tan removal and promotes a brighter complexion.

Upon using the face wash, I noticed its pleasant fragrance, which is not overpowering. The consistency is creamy and smooth, and a small amount goes a long way. It lathers up well and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. It doesn't strip away natural oils from the skin, which is a common issue with some face washes.

I have combination skin, and this face wash has worked well for me. It effectively removes dirt, excess oil, and impurities, leaving my skin feeling clean and balanced. I also noticed a subtle improvement in my skin's texture and brightness after regular use. While it may not deliver dramatic results overnight, with consistent use, it does contribute to a more radiant complexion.

Another great aspect of this product is Mama Earth's commitment to being environmentally friendly. The packaging is recyclable, and the brand is known for its sustainable practices. It's reassuring to know that I'm using a product that not only benefits my skin but also takes steps towards a greener planet.

However, it's worth noting that individual results may vary depending on various factors such as skin type and sensitivity. Some users may experience a mild tingling sensation due to the natural ingredients, but it should subside quickly.

In conclusion, the Mamaearth Ubtan Natural Face Wash is a refreshing and effective option for those looking to remove tan and brighten their skin. With its natural formulation, delightful fragrance, and the power of turmeric and saffron, it delivers on its promises.

Lotus Professional PhytoRx Clarifying & Soothing Daily Toner, Neem, Vitamin C, Refreshing, Preservative Free, 100 ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,It is a spray bottle, and the spray is nice, it is more concentrated, rather than being misty and spreading everywhere.
Talking about the formula, it is of the consistency of water. The ingredients such as neem and witch hazel are targeted towards clarifying and soothing the skin, also cucumber cools and freshens the skin. Gives a slight warming sensation when applied, as an indication of the potency maybe (or at least that is how I interpret it).
I just spray it directly on my face and press it into my skin as a preparatory skincare step before using the lotus phyto-rx whitening and brightening range.
It is quiet a decent toner, gives a little hydration to the skin, good as a preparatory step. Makes the skin hydrated, smooth and fresh.

Minimalist Pha 3% Alcohol Free Face Toner, 150 Ml | Pore Tightening & Mild Exfoliation For Oily, Acne Prone, Sensitive & Normal Skin | Hydrating Face Toner For Glowing Skin, Pack of 1,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was looking for a pha toner for a really long time since I have dry and sensetive skin and AHAs and BHAs are kinda harsh on my skin. Also PHA is a great form of exfoliator for skin of colour as we are very prone to burns and marks due to high melanin production in our skin+ it takes some time to get rid of marks or pigmentation on our skin.
(Info- how to check if you fall in the category of skin of colour or not? If you tan easily then you fall under the category of skin of colour and if you get red easily then you will under the category of white)

Texture- watery
Feel- once you apply it.It leaves your skin kinda moist, hyderated and smooth I'd say.It also looks watery but once you apply it, it feels like you applied a viscous toner.
Final thoughts- as I said I'll be updating the review after using it for a month am a very stingy when it comes to skincare so here is the thing my mom and I have been using it on a daily basis for 1month.My skin has been loving it since then. I haven't yet faced any problem with this.Toners are not an essential step to the skin care I cannot say that I have seen a huge difference in my skin but this has been a blessing for my dry skin. Sometimes even the gentelest cleanser dry's out my skin but this provides a very good first step hyderation to my skin. I am also very sensitive to smell this product has no additional fragrance but once you take it out on your hand and try to smell you.It has a very mild smell somewhat chemically but once you apply it their is no smell.
Cons- I kinda don't like the packaging I think it could've been better it doesn't looks very travel friendly
But overall I like this proudct üëç‚ù§Ô∏è

Pilgrim Korean Beauty White Lotus Refreshing Face Mist & Toner | Toner for glowing skin | Alcohol-Free Mist & toner for open pores Tightening | Korean skin care products | Women & Men | 100 ml,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great face mist in this price range but the spray nozzle doesn't spray evenly. I shifted it to a different spray bottle, and it's so much better! The product quality is quite good though

Pros:
- Really good face mist for sensitive skin
- Makes the skin smooth and soft upon application

Cons:
- Mine came with a defective nozzle and it sprays half on my forehead and half on my neck
- The fragrance is very strong. if you like it then it's great, but if you don't it'll really bother you

WishCare¬Æ 100% Pure & Natural Rose Water - For Skin, Face & Hair - Steam Distilled - Kannauj Gulab Jal - Spray Skin Toner - Free From Paraben, Alcohol & Chemicals - 200 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have been using Wishcare Kannauj Rose Water for the past month, and I am thoroughly impressed with its quality and effectiveness. As someone who has tried various rose waters, I can confidently say this one stands out for several reasons.

Pros:

Pure and Natural: The first thing I noticed was the purity of this rose water. It is made from Kannauj roses, known for their superior quality. There are no added chemicals or artificial fragrances, making it gentle on the skin.
Refreshing: A spritz of this rose water instantly refreshes my face, providing a cooling effect that is perfect for hot days or after a tiring day.
Hydrating: It hydrates my skin beautifully, leaving it soft and supple. I use it as a toner after cleansing, and it preps my skin perfectly for the next steps in my skincare routine.
Versatile: Apart from using it as a toner, I also mix it with my face masks for added benefits. Sometimes, I even use it to set my makeup, and it works wonderfully.
Lovely Packaging: The bottle is sturdy and the spray mechanism works well, dispensing a fine mist without any wastage.

Cons:

Scent: While I appreciate the natural fragrance of roses, some might find the scent a bit too strong. However, it fades quickly and doesn't linger.
Price: It is slightly on the pricier side compared to other rose waters available in the market. However, given its quality and purity, I believe it's worth the investment.
Overall, I am extremely satisfied with Wishcare Kannauj Rose Water. It has become a staple in my skincare routine, and I love how it makes my skin feel. If you're looking for a natural and effective rose water, I highly recommend giving this one a try!

Khadi Essentials Luxurious Ayurvedic Pure Rose Face Mist, A Toner that's all Rose Oil & Purified Water Perfect For Dry Skin, Enhances Glow, Makeup Remover, 100ml Pure Chemical Free Face Mizzle,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently had the opportunity to try out the Khadi Pure Wild Rose Water for Deep Hydration with Desi Gulaab, and I must say that I am thoroughly impressed with its performance. This product claims to provide deep hydration while utilizing the natural benefits of desi gulaab (wild rose) water, and it certainly delivers on its promises.

Firstly, let's talk about the packaging. The rose water comes in a sturdy and attractive bottle with a convenient spray nozzle. The bottle is well-sealed, ensuring that the product remains fresh and uncontaminated. The spray nozzle allows for easy application and helps distribute the product evenly on the skin.

The fragrance of this rose water is simply divine. It has a beautiful, natural aroma of roses that is not overpowering but rather subtle and pleasant. It instantly uplifts the senses and provides a soothing effect. It's a delight to use, especially during those hot summer days when you need a refreshing pick-me-up.

In terms of hydration, this product truly delivers. The wild rose water is known for its hydrating properties, and I can attest to its effectiveness. I have dry skin, and after using this rose water regularly, I noticed a significant improvement in the overall hydration of my skin. It leaves my skin feeling soft, supple, and nourished, without any greasiness or stickiness. It also helps to balance the pH level of the skin, leaving it looking healthy and radiant.

Another impressive aspect of this rose water is its versatility. Besides being a great hydrating toner, it can also be used as a facial mist, makeup setting spray, or mixed with other skincare products like face masks or serums. I have tried using it in different ways, and it has always provided a refreshing and rejuvenating effect.

One notable highlight of this product is its use of desi gulaab or wild rose water. Khadi has sourced the rose water from indigenous roses, which are known to have higher levels of beneficial compounds. This adds an extra layer of authenticity and quality to the product.

I appreciate that Khadi is a brand known for its commitment to using natural and organic ingredients, and this product is no exception. It is free from harmful chemicals, parabens, and artificial fragrances, making it suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin.

In conclusion, the Khadi Pure Wild Rose Water for Deep Hydration with Desi Gulaab is a remarkable product that lives up to its claims. It provides deep hydration, has a delightful fragrance, and is versatile in its usage. If you're looking for a natural and effective rose water that will leave your skin hydrated and rejuvenated, I highly recommend giving this product a try

Firstly, let's talk about the packaging. The rose water comes in a sturdy and attractive bottle with a convenient spray nozzle. The bottle is well-sealed, ensuring that the product remains fresh and uncontaminated. The spray nozzle allows for easy application and helps distribute the product evenly on the skin.

The fragrance of this rose water is simply divine. It has a beautiful, natural aroma of roses that is not overpowering but rather subtle and pleasant. It instantly uplifts the senses and provides a soothing effect. It's a delight to use, especially during those hot summer days when you need a refreshing pick-me-up.

In terms of hydration, this product truly delivers. The wild rose water is known for its hydrating properties, and I can attest to its effectiveness. I have dry skin, and after using this rose water regularly, I noticed a significant improvement in the overall hydration of my skin. It leaves my skin feeling soft, supple, and nourished, without any greasiness or stickiness. It also helps to balance the pH level of the skin, leaving it looking healthy and radiant.

Another impressive aspect of this rose water is its versatility. Besides being a great hydrating toner, it can also be used as a facial mist, makeup setting spray, or mixed with other skincare products like face masks or serums. I have tried using it in different ways, and it has always provided a refreshing and rejuvenating effect.

One notable highlight of this product is its use of desi gulaab or wild rose water. Khadi has sourced the rose water from indigenous roses, which are known to have higher levels of beneficial compounds. This adds an extra layer of authenticity and quality to the product.

I appreciate that Khadi is a brand known for its commitment to using natural and organic ingredients, and this product is no exception. It is free from harmful chemicals, parabens, and artificial fragrances, making it suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin.

In conclusion, the Khadi Pure Wild Rose Water for Deep Hydration with Desi Gulaab is a remarkable product that lives up to its claims. It provides deep hydration, has a delightful fragrance, and is versatile in its usage. If you're looking for a natural and effective rose water that will leave your skin hydrated and rejuvenated, I highly recommend giving this product a try

Biotique Honey Water Pore Tightening Brightening Toner With Himalayan Waters|Maintains Ph Balance|Moisturized And Hydrated Skin|100% Botanical Extracts|Suitable For All Skin Types|120Ml,Pack of 1,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have been using this toner for more than 7 years now. I started my ctm routine with this toner. I have wavered every now and then and tried many other toners from high-end to new and promising ones, but, I always come back to this. That's the kind of product this is.
It calms the skin and cleanses the open pores and to some extent, helps in minimising them. Now, I am not going to say that it's some sort of miracle elixir which will give overnight results. However, with prolonged use, it does what it promises. (The only other toner which I can say this about is Glycolic Acid toner by the Ordinary.)

Now, I have dry skin, acne free skin. And this toner suits me well. It suits for my mom's combination skin as well.
2 - 3 drops of tea tree oil mixed in 10 ml of this toner had also helped in subduing occasional breakouts. Same (or witch hazel) could be used for oily and acne prone skin as well.
So, if you're someone looking for a useful toner, don't get drawn into flashy social media ads and influncer promotions or promises. This is simple, cost effective, and it does what a toner is supposed to do. Just try this.

Banjaras Premium Rose Water (1L (1000 ml)),5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the bottle quality, rose water consistency is superb, natural rose smell of the extract is soothing. I use it in every homemade face mask as well as everyday toner it gives stunning glow and keeps skin hydrated. That too with 1l quantity in such affordable price, will Definitely use it again.

Only one complain is the damaged lid I received, it wasn't leaking but please double check your packaging as it can be troublesome. Thank you banjaras and amazon.

Cosrx AHA/BHA CLARIFYING TREATMENT Toner,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am an oily sensitive skin girl, so i do have to check precisely before applying anything on my skin. I like minimal products in my skincare so i wanted a toner which can do more than just control sebum. Then i came across this gem and i am happy that i bought it. I bought it for 660 something on sale and I saying it is worth every rps, the quality is 150 ml i am using it twice a day and it is gonna last 3-4 more months. I am posting this review after using it for 2 weeks and my skin has less sebum, no tiny bumps and no open pores. It has lightnen my dark acne marks and i think the skin texture has also slightly improved. Regular use will show the better results. I am goning to stick to it.‚ù§Ô∏è

Kama Ayurveda Pure Rose Water,5.0 out of 5 stars,I must say, Kama Ayurveda rose water is truly one of the finest products in the market. I have been using it for quite some time now and I am impressed by its effectiveness. Unlike some other rose waters, it doesn't leave my skin feeling stretchy. Even after it dries down completely, my skin feels hydrated and supple. It's amazing how I can stretch my skin as I want to frown or smile without feeling like I have put on something. Although I received a damaged product initially, Amazon took appropriate steps to resolve the issue.

Kama Ayurveda Pure Rose Water,5.0 out of 5 stars,This rose water is really, really good. It works like a miracle it kind of gives your skin what it needs, if you have dead skin it‚Äôll exfoliate, if you have dry skin it‚Äôll hydrate, It‚Äôs been part of my skin care since many years I can‚Äôt do without it, I‚Äôll give up my creams if I have to but not this rose water. it‚Äôs the ONLY product that manages to minimize my pores! and calm my skin really well. I spray it all over my face including eyes, it‚Äôs very refreshing, I use it as a toner and each time I wash my face. Yes a bit pricy, but worth it.

I use it on my scalp too after shampoo as a leave in scalp treatment to improve blood circulation for faster hair growth.

This is the BEST rose water I tried so far and I‚Äôll continue to buy it.

Khadi Natural Rose Water Herbal Skin Toner, 210ml|Keeps skin scented and moisturized|Maintain skin's pH balance| Prevents acne|Suitable for All Skin Types,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this khadi natural rose water to use as toner after reading a review from one if the Instagram influencer. Firstly I will transfer a little amount to spray bottle, After using for few days I discovered it doesn‚Äôt do anything as toner but it can be used as a good mist to refresh your skin and before any makeup as it helps to hydrate your skin. As it claims it doesn‚Äôt do anything of cleansing pores, go for it if you are searching for affordable rose water mist
Pro: quantity is good for price range
Con: better to change bottle to spray type

PLIX - THE PLANT FIX Jamun Active Acne Range With Cleanser, 2% Salicylic Acid Serum, Smoothie Moisturizer, & Toner l Reduces Active Acne l Detoxifies The Skin l Soothes Redness l All Skin Types,1.0 out of 5 stars,I was suspicious that the amount of fake reviews and the ads on Instagram, that the product is just a marketing scam, but i ordered it anyway.
It came with a fake handwritten note written by CEO or someone important and also some plant seeds in form of paper, which didn't came to life either.
Coming to the product, it did make the skin feel fresh like it said, but so does every other product.
And the pimple disappearing part of the product, it just removes all the oil and makes the skin too dry, that prevent the pimple forming part.
My face got rashes on the second day of use. Skin became too dry. Even my eyes became dry. So stopped using it.
Better consult your local dermatologist and get their recommendations for your skin. This is just all in one cheap product that may harm your skin type.
And don't trust shark tank product. They are just there to make maximum money however they can.

Anua Heartleaf 77% Soothing Toner I pH 5.5 Skin Trouble Care, Calming Skin, Refreshing, Purifying (250ml / 8.45 fl.oz.),5.0 out of 5 stars,I use this in conjunction with the Anua Heartleaf Oil Cleanser and I really like the duo. I follow the oil cleanser with a gentle cleaner and then periodically use the toner. If my skin is a little dry, I skip the toner but I wouldn't say the toner itself is drying (I just have super sensitive skin). The fact that I can use this toner at all attests to the fact that it is gentle. My skin has really evened out and become much healthier since I started using the Anua products. I am 44 years old with combination, sensitive skin.

The Oradinaray Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution, Pack of 240ml liquid,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use this on my oily, dandruff prone scalp once in 2 weeks. I use it on underarms once a week. Both uses have been very beneficial. Hair use makes the hair feel squeaky clean and get rid of build up. Underarm use has felt good and less stinky but no noticeable difference in terms of lightening. Planning to start using it on arms for treating keratosis polaris or strawberry skin. On the second bottle now. Overall recommend it for any non face exfoliation. Keep in mind it has a very watery consistency and is a strong product. So be careful of it trickling down your face if applying to scalp or trickling down to a wound/cut from where you apply it. Using it with a cotton round when using on skin helps. Applying in small quantities with the head tilted back or with a absorbent head band at the forehead helps when applying to the scalp.

Lotus Professional PhytoRx Clarifying & Soothing Daily Toner, Neem, Vitamin C, Refreshing, Preservative Free, 100 ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,It is a spray bottle, and the spray is nice, it is more concentrated, rather than being misty and spreading everywhere.
Talking about the formula, it is of the consistency of water. The ingredients such as neem and witch hazel are targeted towards clarifying and soothing the skin, also cucumber cools and freshens the skin. Gives a slight warming sensation when applied, as an indication of the potency maybe (or at least that is how I interpret it).
I just spray it directly on my face and press it into my skin as a preparatory skincare step before using the lotus phyto-rx whitening and brightening range.
It is quiet a decent toner, gives a little hydration to the skin, good as a preparatory step. Makes the skin hydrated, smooth and fresh.

Mamaearth Vitamin C Toner 200.0 ml Pack,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have been using toners from different brands for quite some time now. Some of them I found a bit too strong for the skin, and some of them had a really strong smell. Lately I‚Äôve been using this one by Mama Earth and I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôll be using this for a long time. My search for a good toner has come to rest. I apply it every morning as well as in my night skin care routine. Its scent is soothing, and it soothes my skin as well. I use it either by directly applying on my face with my fingers or sometimes with a spray on. It is absolutely amazing for daily use, and I would recommend using this immediately after using a good face wash before sleeping. It‚Äôll work wonders. Plus, vitamin C and cucumber being highly nourishing for the skin, it‚Äôs a superb purchase!

The Moms Co. Natural Daily Vitamin C Face Toner| Alcohol-free l Tighten Pore l Even-Tone-Hydrate Skin (Pack of 100 ml),2.0 out of 5 stars,It has a strong fragrance, and I am fragrance sensitive. That's why I am not using it. And one more thing, it does not come with a spray nozzle, so it would be a little bit difficult to apply, as the product has liquid consistency.

The True Therapy Retexturize 10% Glycolic Acid Toner, Face Toner For Glowing Skin, Pore Tightening Toner For Men & Women, All Skin Types, Numbuzin Toner With Witch Hazel - 200 Ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is such great value for money. 200ml at this price point is a great deal. I used this for my face, arms, back, and scalp. It has cleared my clogged pores, pimples, and sebum. I soaked my scalp with this toner for 30 mins before washing, for 2 weeks, and it virtually removed all my dandruff and excess oil. My scalp has got healthier to a point where I wash my hair less frequently per week because it stays clean longer. Overall great quality product.

It's been a total game-changer for my skin. After using it for a few weeks, I've noticed a significant improvement in texture and tone. My skin looks brighter, smoother, and more even. The glycolic acid helps to exfoliate and unclog pores, leaving my skin feeling clean and refreshed. It's also helped to reduce acne and prevent new breakouts. I've tried other toners before, but this one is definitely my favorite. Highly recommend!"

Do use twice a week in the beginning

Usually my hair wash lasted 1-2 days and now it lasts upto 3 days and even bearable on the 4th after only one use of glycolic acid.
Leave it in for 30-45 mins before hairwash, you can apply regular oil on the ends and even some on the scalp after 15 mins of using the acid, definitely works wonders.

Firstly I will transfer a little amount to spray bottle, After using for few days I discovered it doesn‚Äôt do anything as toner but it can be used as a good mist to refresh your skin and before any makeup as it helps to hydrate your skin. As it claims it doesn‚Äôt do anything of cleansing pores, go for it if you are searching for affordable rose water mist
Pro: quantity is good for price range
Con: better to change bottle to spray type

Khadi Natural Rose Water Herbal Skin Toner, 210ml|Keeps skin scented and moisturized|Maintain skin's pH balance| Prevents acne|Suitable for All Skin Types,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this khadi natural rose water to use as toner after reading a review from one if the Instagram influencer. Firstly I will transfer a little amount to spray bottle, After using for few days I discovered it doesn‚Äôt do anything as toner but it can be used as a good mist to refresh your skin and before any makeup as it helps to hydrate your skin. As it claims it doesn‚Äôt do anything of cleansing pores, go for it if you are searching for affordable rose water mist
Pro: quantity is good for price range
Con: better to change bottle to spray type

Khadi Natural Rose Water Herbal Skin Toner, 210ml|Keeps skin scented and moisturized|Maintain skin's pH balance| Prevents acne|Suitable for All Skin Types,1.0 out of 5 stars,I earlier Loved khadi natural and was frequently buying it , Last time I purchased this toner which comes with good aroma and smell.
But this time the smell entirely changed .
I don't really know whether it is a spoiled one or not .
Even I found that lots of users mentioned the same in khadi natural website about this toner.
Please advise what's wrong here
Going to quit using if I did not get any update on my review

WishCare 10% AHA + 1% BHA Body Lotion - Smooths Rough & Bumpy Skin - Glycolic & Lactic Acid Body Lotion with Niacinamide - 200 Ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,Been a year I was searching for something that would suffice both hydration and concerns on my body and I found it finally. I'm obsessed with the Wishcare AHA BHA Lotion! As someone with combination skin, I struggle with finding products that balance exfoliation and hydration. This lotion delivers on both fronts!

The formula is lightweight and non-greasy, making it perfect for daily use. The AHA and BHA combination gently exfoliates my skin, leaving it feeling smooth and looking brighter. I've noticed a significant reduction in blackheads and whiteheads, and my skin tone is more even than ever.

What I love most about this lotion is its gentle yet effective approach. It doesn't strip my skin of its natural oils, unlike other exfoliating products I've tried. Instead, it leaves my skin feeling soft, supple, and hydrated.

If you're looking for a gentle exfoliating lotion that won't dry out your skin, look no further! The Wishcare AHA BHA Lotion is a game-changer.

Pros: Gentle, effective, hydrating, non-greasy, reduces blackheads and whiteheads, evens skin tone

Cons: None!

Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion For Dry, Sensitive Skin| 30 G| Moisturizer With Shea Butter| Non-Greasy, Fragrance-Free| Paraben, Sulphate Free,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best face moisturizer I've come across in a long time.
It's very good for face and lips as well.
Doesn't feel stickey or anything, extremely light.

Just stand below a fan or in Ac for 30 sec and this is absorbed completely.
If your face sweats a lot , then let it get absorbed a bit longer and you'll be fine even if you sweat later.
I saw big difference in my skin's texture after regular application.
but it's very expensive, definitely recommended if you're ok with the price.
Don't buy the 30g pack though, 80g pack is more reasonably prices in comparison.

Vaseline Healthy Bright, Sun + Pollution Protection Daily Moisturizer, 400ml, for Glowing Skin, 2-in-1 Body Lotion with SPF 30, Fast Absorbing and Non-sticky, for Dry Skin, for Men & Women,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am here to order the product again and write a review after using it for 4 months daily. The smell is good but does not last long. Its texture is like Butter, so thick, creamy, soft and nourishing. Felt like body butter. It easily gets absorbed in the skin. The next day when you shower, you can still feel the product on your skin, that's how long-lasting it is. It does protect from the sun for 3-4 hours but you will have to reapply it after that.

Vaseline Healthy Bright, Sun + Pollution Protection Daily Moisturizer, 400ml, for Glowing Skin, 2-in-1 Body Lotion with SPF 30, Fast Absorbing and Non-sticky, for Dry Skin, for Men & Women,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am here to order the product again and write a review after using it for 4 months daily. The smell is good but does not last long. Its texture is like Butter, so thick, creamy, soft and nourishing. Felt like body butter. It easily gets absorbed in the skin. The next day when you shower, you can still feel the product on your skin, that's how long-lasting it is. It does protect from the sun for 3-4 hours but you will have to reapply it after that. Do not leave the white cast. A highly recommended product.

And i can see the difference, It hydrates the skin and helps to brightens it. After using just one week you can see the difference . And the product is super light weight it absorbs in the skin super fast and it is non sticky.
It has a mild scent , but it is similar to some kind of creams scent.
By using twice a day for a week you can see the huge difference in the skin texture.
Please go for it.
It is a worthy product.

Vaseline Gluta-Hya Dewy Radiance, 200ml, Serum-In-Lotion, Boosted With GlutaGlow, for Visibly Brighter Skin from 1st Use,4.0 out of 5 stars,Brought this specifically for summers as my bath and body, body creams where comparatively thicker. The texture is very smooth just like it says serum-like. The coverage is less, you need to apply slightly more than your nivea or vaseline lotions to cover your body. There is no glow as such. There's no noticeable effect on skin either. Moisturizing is so-so. If you are too much outdoors, you might need to re-apply. In totality, a good additional serum with your regular lotion.
Pros - Light weight, Fast absorbent, Non greasy, Perfect for summers or light weather.
Cons- Less coverage, Expensive for the amount in the tube, no real effect on skin, not very hydrating.

Vaseline Gluta-Hya Dewy Radiance, 200ml, Serum-In-Lotion, Boosted With GlutaGlow, for Visibly Brighter Skin from 1st Use,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently tried out the Vaseline Healthy Bright Gluta Hya Dewy Radiance Serum in Lotion, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. As someone who struggles with dull and dehydrated skin, this product has been a game-changer for me.

First of all, I love the lightweight texture of this serum lotion. It applies smoothly and absorbs quickly without leaving any greasy residue behind. This is a big plus for me as I prefer products that don't feel heavy on my skin.

After incorporating this serum lotion into my skincare routine, I noticed a visible improvement in the brightness and radiance of my complexion. The gluta (glutathione) infused in the lotion has worked wonders in reducing dullness, giving my skin a healthy glow. Additionally, the hya (hyaluronic acid) has provided deep hydration, making my skin feel plump and hydrated throughout the day.

Another aspect I appreciate is the pleasant fragrance of the lotion. It adds a refreshing touch to my skincare experience, making it a joy to use daily.

Overall, the Vaseline Healthy Bright Gluta Hya Dewy Radiance Serum in Lotion has become a staple in my skincare routine. It has addressed my skin concerns effectively, leaving me with brighter, hydrated, and radiant-looking skin. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a boost in their skincare routine.

Himalaya Herbals Cocoa Butter Intensive Body Lotion, 400ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good. Affordable.
,Lee...
Himalaya Herbals Cocoa Butter Intensive Body Lotion, 400ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the Himalaya Herbals Cocoa Butter Intensive Body Lotion, and I must say it has made a noticeable difference in my daily skincare routine. The product is elegantly packaged in a sleek white 400ml bottle with a green flip-top cap, secured by a protective seal. The front label, adorned with images of cocoa butter and wheat germ, clearly showcases its primary ingredients, while the back label provides all the necessary information about the lotion.

The lotion is designed to deeply moisturize and repair dry skin, leveraging the hydrating and nourishing properties of cocoa butter and wheat germ oil. I find it perfect for everyday use, as it effectively keeps my skin hydrated and smooth throughout the day. One of the aspects I appreciate the most is its non-irritating formula. Unlike other lotions that can cause itching or discomfort, this product has been gentle on my skin, which is a significant plus.

The scent of the lotion is another commendable feature. It has a mild, pleasant fragrance that is not overpowering, making it suitable for those who prefer subtle scents. Additionally, the lotion offers great value for money, considering the quantity and its overall effectiveness. It spreads easily and absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving no greasy residue behind, which enhances its usability.

However, there are a few areas where I believe the product could improve. While the lotion does an excellent job of moisturizing my skin during the day, I have noticed that its effect tends to wear off by night, particularly on days with higher pollution levels. Although it generally lasts the entire day, it doesn‚Äôt remain effective overnight. In comparison to the Patanjali Herbal body lotion, I feel that the latter provides slightly better hydration and overall skin health benefits.

One more thing worth mentioning is that I purchased this lotion through Amazon Prime, and I was very pleased with the timely delivery. It arrived promptly, which added to the convenience of purchasing this product online.

Despite these minor shortcomings, I wholeheartedly recommend the Himalaya Herbals Cocoa Butter Intensive Body Lotion. It is a reliable choice for daily skincare, offering essential hydration and nourishment. I hope Himalaya continues to invest in research and development to further enhance this product‚Äôs effectiveness. With a few improvements, this lotion has the potential to become an even more outstanding skincare solution.

It brightens the skin for some minutes when applied. Have applied for few months, but it does not change the original skin tone much.
When applied on face it gives a little itchy and tingling sensation for few minutes but not when I apply it on hand or neck.

Vaseline Gluta-Hya Flawless Glow Lotion | For Face & Body |Bright & Eventone Skin | Glutathione & Pro-Retinol Infused Moisturizer 200ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this for my wife. She has been struggling with dark spots and dull, uneven skin tone, but Vaseline Gluta-Hya serum-in-lotion has been a total game changer for her. With its powerful GlutaGlow technology and Pro-Retinol exfoliating properties, her skin has never looked more even and radiant. She also loved that it's super hydrating thanks to the Hyaluron, which makes the skin look dewy and youthful. The texture is amazing too - it's not too heavy or greasy, and it absorbs quickly so anyone can apply makeup right after. Overall, I'd highly recommend this product to anyone looking to brighten their complexion and improve their overall skin health. It's truly a miracle product!

Vaseline Gluta-Hya Flawless Glow Lotion | For Face & Body |Bright & Eventone Skin | Glutathione & Pro-Retinol Infused Moisturizer 200ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,Im almost done with this vaseline serum. I love how it feels on the skin and gives you an instant glow and brightening effect. I use it on my entire body and it's so lightweight, smells good, and works wonders if you want to brighten ups your skin. I recommend using a thicker lotion on top if you have dry skin or even eczema. I use the La Roche posey with niacinamide on top and my skin remains so soft nd bright for so long that I keep rubbing my legs LMAOOOOO my skin is just so soft!!!!!

Vaseline Gluta-Hya Flawless Glow Lotion | For Face & Body |Bright & Eventone Skin | Glutathione & Pro-Retinol Infused Moisturizer 200ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,Please note this is not a "Moisturizing" lotion, it literally feels like a serum for the body. I recommend adding a shower oil to your routine. I also use a Kojic Acid soap. However I do I see a a difference in the hyperpigmentation that was on my back after about 5 days of use! Get it!

Vaseline Gluta-Hya Flawless Glow Lotion | For Face & Body |Bright & Eventone Skin | Glutathione & Pro-Retinol Infused Moisturizer 200ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's nice, haven't seen results yet but that's because I'm not consistent. I would say the smell isn't perfumey or anything, it just smell like a lotion. I will say tho, don't expect this to hydrate your skin it is just a serum for your body like your face you need to put a lotion after towards, and if you want to be extra you and add an oil on top of that.

Vaseline Gluta-Hya Flawless Glow Lotion | For Face & Body |Bright & Eventone Skin | Glutathione & Pro-Retinol Infused Moisturizer 200ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,It absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn't not have scent. It brightens the skin for some minutes when applied. Have applied for few months, but it does not change the original skin tone much.
When applied on face it gives a little itchy and tingling sensation for few minutes but not when I apply it on hand or neck.
Light in texture, worth purchasing.

VLCC Almond Honey Deep Nourishing & Skin Brightening Body Lotion - 350ml + 350ml | Buy One Get One | Deep Nourishment, Glowing & Youthful Skin | With Almond Oil, Honey, Cocoa Butter & Aloe Vera.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiccccccceeeeeeeeeeeee . . .

I became a fan of the brand VLCC after purchasing multiple times the 'timeless' Alpine Mint & Tea Tree gentle refreshing face wash, which is the best so far, to any day invigorate a "drained by heat face". And after reading a multiple pro-reviews here on Amazon, I decided to go ahead with this as well. Then, I opted for today, this day, by the end of May, my birthday to inaugurate its first usage. With no regrets, let me tell you that this body lotion, this moisturiser, this super saver 1-on-1 offered mild concoction which encourages a lush-n-lavish usage to pamper oneself with, is worth of every drop when it smears over you to leave a feeling behind which is supple, soft and within seconds moisturising. Even though its texture is a little pasty, for perhaps skin brightening purposes, that subtle blend of almonds oil and honey nectar releases such a Divine fragrance that is lasting yet non intimidating to refresh your senses. Welcoming enough, after applying this easily absorbent cream base, it feels so inviting that I wouldn't mind at all body-bathing in it if exaggerated to any much extent! Moreover, I totally adore, the shape of those securingly bold, hand comforting and user friendly pump bottles. There exhibits a certain finesse to all of it. In the names of Hekate-K√°li, K√°li-Babushk√° and Babushk√°-Hekate, of this special day of mines, I dearly thankyou from the bottom of my three hearts.

Simple Kind To Skin Hydrating Light Moisturiser Lotion 125ml | For All Day-Long Hydration | For All Skin types,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently tried the Simple Face Moisturizer, and I have to say, I'm quite impressed. This moisturizer lives up to its name with its simplicity andeffectiveness.
First and foremost, I appreciate that it's fragrance-free, making it suitable for sensitive skin like mine. It feels light on the skin and doesn't leave a greasy or sticky residue.
The moisturizer does a great job of hydrating my skin throughout the day, keeping it feeling soft and supple. I also noticed that it didn't cause any breakouts or irritation, which is a big plus.
The packaging is convenient. A little goes a long way, so the bottle lasts a while.
Overall, the Simple Face Moisturizer is a reliable and affordable choice for daily hydration, especially if you have sensitive skin. also this is my 3rd bottle.

Simple Kind To Skin Hydrating Light Moisturiser Lotion 125ml | For All Day-Long Hydration | For All Skin types,5.0 out of 5 stars,OK HEAR ME OUT!!

Backstory:
(I have oily and sensitive skin btw)
Have tried few moisturizers like Cetaphil, Plum but unfortunately nothing worked out for my skin. My skin always end up breaking out or just have this greasy feel after apply. ykhat I mean?? So yeah was gonna order 'Simple' face wash and thought might as well try the 'Simple' moisturizer. Best decision.

Actual review:
Been using it for like a week or two, and honestly this moisturizer is the best one I've ever tried!!
It's just very hydrating and light weight
Blends on my skin very well
On applying, does not leave this weird greasy feel that every other moisturizer left on my skin. No fragrance too!
Makes my skin much more smoother, healthier and hydrated. JUST GO FOR IT IF YOU HAVE OILY SKIN!!

Quantity might be a little less tho idk how long the bottle will last...might as well update it when it gets over so you have an idea üòä‚ú®

However, there are some drawbacks to this as well. First, this is not "All Day-Long Hydration"; secondly, you might need to apply more to achieve the "All Day-Long" guarantee, leaving your face looking oily and making you uncomfortable. For people with dry skin types, don't go for this. For the rest, this should be a good moisturiser for everyday use :)

Vaseline Derma Care Advanced Repair Body Lotion|| For Sensitive|| Dry Skin|| Non Greasy|| Long Lasting Moisturisation|| 400 ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,For 2 reasons I feel it seems different. I have been using this lotion for months now. This is my 1st time buying it online. Here's how I felt it is slightly different:

1. Bottle instantly felt a little softer than the ones I already have. No other change in looks.

2. It has more fragrance than usual. Still mild and doesn't irritate my skin.

Maybe, the company tried to provide it for less to the customers. The lotion otherwise doesn't feel much different on my skin. It could be a tad bit more hydrating and cheaper than the one I bought offline. It however works great for dry sensitive skin. In case you have dry skin, give it a try, it is one of the best options from a non pharmaceutical brand. I recommend it. I ordered 3 and would order more in future.

Vaseline Derma Care Advanced Repair Body Lotion|| For Sensitive|| Dry Skin|| Non Greasy|| Long Lasting Moisturisation|| 400 ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,For 2 reasons I feel it seems different. I have been using this lotion for months now. This is my 1st time buying it online. Here's how I felt it is slightly different:

1. Bottle instantly felt a little softer than the ones I already have. No other change in looks.

2. It has more fragrance than usual. Still mild and doesn't irritate my skin.

Maybe, the company tried to provide it for less to the customers. The lotion otherwise doesn't feel much different on my skin. It could be a tad bit more hydrating and cheaper than the one I bought offline. It however works great for dry sensitive skin. In case you have dry skin, give it a try, it is one of the best options from a non pharmaceutical brand. I recommend it. I ordered 3 and would order more in future.

Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion 354ml (for Normal and Dry Skin),4.0 out of 5 stars,Seller: The GlobalCart
Delivery Speed: It arrived 1 day late.
Courier used by seller: On Dot Courier
Expiry date: 5 months from now (Apr 2016)

The Product (Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion): These is a very good lotion for dry skin whether you are dealing only with dry skin or conditions like Eczema, Psoriasis etc. It is fragrance free and that is an absolute must when dealing with any type of skin ailment. The Oatmeal is indeed calming and soothing to the skin. The pump dispenser ensures that the product stays hygienic and is not wasted either. The consistency of the lotion is between a typical watery lotion like Cetaphil and a good cream like Cerave. it is just right - neither watery nor too thick. That ensures that it stays on your skin long enough to keep it moisturized without feeling heavy or tacky. Dimethicone is a form of an OTC silicone that is indeed a skin protectant. It is missing any fancy ingredients like Ceramides or Hyaluronic Acid that are rather helpful for compromised skin. their Aveeno Eczema Relief cream is almost the same formula as this one with a Ceramide added to the list. So, if you are considering an Aveeno lotion for an infant/child with Eczema, that is a better option. However, if you are a grown up like me who also uses prescription ointments/creams periodically to manage their skin condition & need a good day time body moisturizer to keep the skin hydrated & calm at a very low price, this lotion is just perfect!

The lotion is a 5 star product, the close expiry made me deduct 1 star.

This body lotion has quickly become a must-have in my daily skincare routine.

The first thing that caught my attention was the lovely fragrance. It's not too overpowering but leaves a subtle, pleasant scent that lasts for hours. The texture of the lotion is perfect ‚Äì not too thick and not too runny, making it easy to apply and absorb into the skin.

What really sets this lotion apart is its moisturizing power. It leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft and hydrated. I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall texture and suppleness of my skin since using it. Even in the dry winter months, this lotion keeps my skin feeling smooth and healthy.

NIVEA Shea Smooth 400ml Body Lotion | 48 H Moisturization | With Deep Moisture Serum & Shea Butter | Non Greasy & Healthy Looking Skin,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently started using NIVEA Shea Smooth 400ml Body Lotion, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. This product has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine, and I can't stop raving about it. Here's why I love it so much:

First and foremost, the 48-hour moisturization claim is no joke. As someone with dry skin, finding a lotion that truly keeps my skin hydrated for an extended period has always been a challenge. But this NIVEA lotion, with its Deep Moisture Serum and Shea, has exceeded my expectations. Even in the harshest winter conditions, my skin feels soft and supple throughout the day.

The shea butter in this lotion is a game-changer. It adds an extra layer of richness and indulgence to the moisturization, leaving my skin feeling incredibly nourished. The texture of the lotion is smooth and creamy, making it a pleasure to apply. It absorbs quickly, so I can get dressed without any waiting around, and it doesn't leave a greasy residue.

What I appreciate most about this product is its versatility. I can use it on both my body and hands, and it works wonders in both areas. My hands, in particular, tend to get very dry, especially with frequent hand washing. This lotion has been a savior, keeping my hands soft and preventing them from becoming rough and cracked.

The 400ml size is also a great value for the price. It lasts a long time, even with daily use, which is fantastic. The packaging is convenient, and the pump dispenser makes it easy to get just the right amount of product.

In conclusion, NIVEA Shea Smooth Body Lotion is a must-have for anyone seeking long-lasting moisturization and soft, smooth skin. I can't recommend it enough. It's become my go-to lotion, and I'll definitely be repurchasing when I run out. Give it a try, and I'm sure you'll fall in love with it just as I have!

NIVEA Shea Smooth 400ml Body Lotion | 48 H Moisturization | With Deep Moisture Serum & Shea Butter | Non Greasy & Healthy Looking Skin,4.0 out of 5 stars,All these products which are chemically rich, should not be used for long run, if you really want a smooth and good looking skin, I would recommend to use CeraVe Daily Mosturizing lotion :

https://amzn.to/3MnePuL

It's very light, it spreads super easy and yet it provides deep hydration. It leaves the skin extremely soft. I don't usually like unscented products, but it doesn't smell like chemistry, it's a very pleasant smelling product. It's going to be hard to change moisturizer after it!

You will thank me later :)

The lotion has a good fragrance too. And it is great on the skin. But I wont recommend for people who are exposed to harsh sun. If you are an indoor person, this product is very effective.

NIVEA Shea Smooth 400ml Body Lotion | 48 H Moisturization | With Deep Moisture Serum & Shea Butter | Non Greasy & Healthy Looking Skin,4.0 out of 5 stars,All these products which are chemically rich, should not be used for long run, if you really want a smooth and good looking skin, I would recommend to use CeraVe Daily Mosturizing lotion :

https://amzn.to/3MnePuL

It's very light, it spreads super easy and yet it provides deep hydration. It leaves the skin extremely soft. I don't usually like unscented products, but it doesn't smell like chemistry, it's a very pleasant smelling product. It's going to be hard to change moisturizer after it!

You will thank me later :)

Vaseline Light Hydrate Serum In Lotion, 400 ml | Superlight & Non-Sticky Body Lotion for Hydration Boost,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've tried numerous moisturizers, but Vaseline Light Hydrate Moisturizer stands out for its lightweight, non-greasy formula that absorbs quickly into my skin.

Soft, supple skin that feels hydrated all day long! I love that it's enriched with micro-droplets of Vaseline Jelly, which helps lock in moisture for up to 8-9 hrs.

This moisturizer is perfect for daily use, especially during the summer months when I want a lightweight, non-greasy feel. It's also great for sensitive skin, as it's fragrance-free and hypoallergenic.

Vaseline Light Hydrate Serum In Lotion, 400 ml | Superlight & Non-Sticky Body Lotion for Hydration Boost,1.0 out of 5 stars,It does have a cooling effect on skin but doesn't do what it's made for. It doesn't hydrate the skin at all. I've tried all different variations of vaseline body lotion and this one's the worst. It dries my skin even more and makes it patchy. Never thought vaseline body lotion would turn out like this. And it's just not me... Everyone in my family used this and got their skin dry and patchy. Now I have to order a new one and take care of my skin for atleast a week to reverse the damage.

,Kamal Roy
WOW Skin Science Shea Butter With Lactic Acid Body Lotion | Hydrates Very Dry Skin | Long Lasting 48 hrs Moisturization | Smoothens Rough, Flaky Skin | Calms Itchy Skin - 400ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,I can provide some general information about the ingredients in the WOW Skin Science Shea Butter and Cocoa Butter Moisturizing Body Lotion. Please note that individual reactions to cosmetic products can vary, and it's essential to perform a patch test if you have sensitive skin or specific allergies. Here's an overview of the ingredients:

1. **Purified Water:** This is the base for the lotion.

2. **Cetyl Alcohol:** This is a fatty alcohol commonly used in cosmetic products as an emollient and emulsifier.

3. **Dicaprylyl Carbonate:** It is a synthetic emollient used to help soften and smooth the skin.

4. **Glyceryl Monostearate:** An emulsifier that helps blend water and oil-based ingredients in the lotion.

5. **Isopropyl Myristate:** An emollient that can help make the skin feel smooth.

6. **Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides:** These are derived from coconut oil and are used as emollients in skincare products.

7. **Isoamyl Laurate:** A skin-conditioning agent that can help improve the spreadability of the lotion.

8. **Shea Butter and Cocoa Butter:** These are natural butters known for their moisturizing properties.

9. **Sodium PCA:** A naturally occurring humectant that helps to retain moisture in the skin.

10. **Betaine Anhydrous:** A humectant and anti-irritant that helps maintain skin hydration.

11. **Beta Vulgaris (Beet) Root Extract:** This extract may contain antioxidants and vitamins beneficial for the skin.

12. **Moroccan Argan Oil and Sweet Almond Oil:** These are natural oils that can provide additional moisture and nourishment to the skin.

13. **Aloe Vera Extract:** Aloe vera is known for its soothing and hydrating properties.

14. **D Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5):** This is a provitamin of B5 that is used to moisturize and condition the skin.

15. **Fragrance:** Fragrances are added to provide a pleasant scent. If you have sensitive skin, fragrance can sometimes cause irritation.

16. **Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid):** This is known for its ability to retain water and provide hydration to the skin.

17. **Allantoin:** Allantoin is often used for its soothing and skin-conditioning properties.

18. **Disodium EDTA:** It is a chelating agent used to stabilize and preserve the product.

19. **Sodium Benzoate and Phenoxyethanol:** These are preservatives used to prevent the growth of harmful microorganisms in the product.

20. **Ethylhexylglycerin:** A skin-conditioning agent that can also function as a preservative.

Overall, many of the ingredients listed are commonly found in skincare products and are generally considered safe for use. However, individual reactions can vary, so if you have sensitive skin or specific allergies, it's a good idea to perform a patch test and discontinue use if you experience any adverse reactions. If you have specific concerns or skin conditions, it's always a good idea to consult with a dermatologist.

WOW Skin Science Shea Butter With Lactic Acid Body Lotion | Hydrates Very Dry Skin | Long Lasting 48 hrs Moisturization | Smoothens Rough, Flaky Skin | Calms Itchy Skin - 400ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the WOW Skin Science Shea Butter and Cocoa Butter Moisturizing Body Lotion, and I must say it has been a game-changer for my dry skin! This product deserves all the praise it can get. Let me share my experience with you.

First and foremost, the packaging is simple yet elegant. The pump dispenser makes it convenient to use and ensures there's no wastage. Kudos to WOW Skin Science for their attention to detail.

Upon applying the lotion, I was immediately greeted by a heavenly scent of shea butter and cocoa butter. It's a rich and soothing fragrance that instantly uplifts my mood. The consistency of the lotion is perfect‚Äînot too thick or runny‚Äîand it spreads smoothly over my skin, making the application effortless.

What truly sets this body lotion apart is its exceptional moisturizing power. My skin tends to get dry and flaky, especially during the colder months, but this lotion has worked wonders in restoring hydration and leaving my skin feeling silky-smooth. It absorbs quickly without any greasy residue, which is fantastic since I can get dressed immediately after application.

The formulation of shea butter and cocoa butter is a winning combination. Not only do they provide intense hydration, but they also nourish and rejuvenate the skin, making it appear more radiant and healthy. I've noticed a significant improvement in the texture and suppleness of my skin since I started using this lotion.

Moreover, I appreciate that WOW Skin Science prioritizes natural ingredients and avoids harsh chemicals. This body lotion is free from parabens, sulfates, mineral oils, and other harmful additives. It's reassuring to know that I'm using a product that cares for my skin's health.

In terms of value for money, WOW Skin Science delivers yet again. The bottle is generously sized, and a little goes a long way, so it lasts for quite some time. Considering the quality and effectiveness of the product, I find it to be reasonably priced and worth every penny.

To sum it up, the WOW Skin Science Shea Butter and Cocoa Butter Moisturizing Body Lotion is a top-notch product that I highly recommend to anyone seeking intense hydration and nourishment for their skin. It ticks all the boxes‚Äîfrom the luxurious fragrance to the effective moisturizing properties and the use of natural ingredients. Trust me, your skin will thank you for giving it the pampering it deserves. Go ahead and indulge!

However, it may not provide enough moisture for those with very dry skin, especially in harsh winter months. The texture is a bit thin, so I find myself reapplying it more often than I'd like. Also, it doesn't absorb as quickly as some other moisturizers I've used, leaving a slight residue on the skin. Overall, it's a good budget option for everyday use, but there are better moisturizers out there if you're looking for long-lasting hydration or something more nourishing.

Parachute Advansed Cocoa Repair Body Lotion , Intense Moisture, 400ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this Parachute Advansed Cocoa repair Body Lotion with Pure Coconut Milk & Cocoa butter, 100% Natural Moisturiser, 250ml to heal and hydrate my dry and damaged skin. I was very impressed by the quality and effectiveness of this body lotion. The body lotion is made of natural ingredients, such as pure coconut milk and cocoa butter, which nourish and moisturize the skin. The body lotion also has a light and non-greasy texture, which spreads easily on the skin and gets absorbed quickly. The body lotion also has a sweet and pleasant fragrance, which makes me feel refreshed and calm. The body lotion is suitable for all skin types, and it does not cause any irritation or allergy. The body lotion also comes in a handy squeeze bottle, which dispenses the right amount of product and prevents wastage. The body lotion is also very affordable, as it lasts for a long time and provides great value for money. This body lotion is a great product for anyone who wants a soothing and repairing body lotion with coconut milk and cocoa butter. It is high-quality, effective, and easy to use. I highly recommend it!

Parachute Advansed Cocoa Repair Body Lotion , Intense Moisture, 400ml,3.0 out of 5 stars,This smells soooo good. It has this sweet berry kind of smell. But both smell and moisturizing benefits don't last long. It keeps my skin moisturized mostly for 2 hours. Smell also dissappears after applying. It absorbs fast though. Overall pretty good for the price.

It doesn't not contain any fragrance which is what I was looking for in the body lotion. It also helps with uneven skin tone and body acne. Also, surprisingly it also enough moisturing if you are staying in humid climate places. I would definitely recommend it.

Himalaya Nourishing Body Lotion, 400ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've a dry skin. I use it regularly every day at night. The Moisturizing doesn't stay for long. I apply at night and by morning my skin feels dry again. But for my other family members it is good. The fragrance is very soothing and mild. So overall a good product but not recommended for super dry skin.

Be Bodywise Body Acne Reduction Kit with 1% Salicylic Acid Body Wash & 10% Niacinamide Hydrating Face & Body Lotion | Prevents Body Acne, Exfoliates & Promotes Glowing Skin | 450 mL,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've bought this thrice ever since I found it, trust me it's amazing and totally does as it says! The body wash and niacinamide moisturizer duo totally cleared out my back and chest acne, even the dark spots I had before I started using them. After i first emptied out the bottle i haven't yet gotten acne as bad as it was before, if anything I'd say i have only gotten one and that too went away in days all thanks to this. I still use it everyday cause it's just so good.

Be Bodywise Body Acne Reduction Kit with 1% Salicylic Acid Body Wash & 10% Niacinamide Hydrating Face & Body Lotion | Prevents Body Acne, Exfoliates & Promotes Glowing Skin | 450 mL,4.0 out of 5 stars,I had back acne problem for a very long time. I tried everything. But it did not go away. Thanks to this Bodywise body wash product which really worked just after using it for 7 days. I can see the difference on my body. Smell of the product is really good. I could give the rating as 5, but did give 4 for following reasons:
1> The body lotion does not work that much.
2> *** One caution**** use this body wash product ONLY if you have back acne and oily skin. It will work just wonderful. But if you have normal skin and no acne issue, do not use the product.
3> You might feel itching sensation after using the body wash. In that case use Boroline suthol after you bath. The itching sensation will go away and the body wash product will take care of your acne.

Vaseline Healthy Bright, Daily Brightening Daily Moisturizer, 400 ml, for Glowing Skin, with Vitamin B3, Visibly Radiant Skin in 2 Weeks, Lightweight, Non-sticky, Non-Oily Body Lotion, for Dry Skin,5.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted a whitening Moisturizer because my skin care only includes Cleanse and Moisturizer and sunscreen..Buit my skin is combination and after I cleanse few parts of face become very flaky which thus Moisturizer can Moisturizer very properly, in thus regard buy Cocoa vaseline it's the best one (1st option ) and this vaseline would be 2nd option..since I have active acne it doesn't stimulate it least and freshens the face with a glow...Go for it
It's not very sticky but neither quite moisturizing..Thank God I was scared to death to receive damaged or leaked parcel, but it wasn't so. It's quite worth for the price, MRP is above 400...so I bought it for 245...So its okay..It's makes skin quite plump though I use it with another moisturizer (it made my skin oily and dark) together with whitening vaseline it's works quite good for me..The flakiness also disappears with smooth skin...Live it no strong smell..thats why I like Cocoa one fornits smell and moisturizing effect..

Dove Body Love Nourished Radiance Body Lotion For Very Dry Skin 48hrs Moisturisation Paraben Free with Plant Based moisturiser Soft Radiant Skin 400ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,Since the time I have understood my skin type, I can surely say that I have very dry skin and it's extremely sensitive. As soon as winters approach I start worrying about my skin care. My skin goes bit scaly and in turn amounts to lot of itching during winters. No matter how much oil or any moisturizing lotion I apply on my skin, everything just vanishes in 1 or 2 hours making my skin look dull again. But now all my worries has taken the back seat since I have started using Dove's nourished radiance rich body lotion. First of all it's very light weight and easy to apply. It quickly absorbs into your skin. This body lotion keeps my skin hydrated for longest hours I can imagine. I have never experienced my skin looking hydrated for almost 12 hours considering the fact my skin is extremely dry. It immediately gives the smooth and soft texture feeling to my skin. The most important thing and the biggest plus point for me is that it smells heaven. The fragrance is very subtle and it gives a refreshing sense. It's been a while that I am using this and I am very happy with this product.

Vaseline Intensive Care, Aloe Fresh Hydrating Body Lotion, 400 ml, for Fresh, Hydrated Skin, with 100% Pure Aloe Vera Extract, for Dry, Rough Skin, for Men & Women,5.0 out of 5 stars,This lotion is good as all Vaseline lotions are. But I didn't like the smell which is slightly like that of green leaves, may be others find it good. This one is good for summers but I'd prefer deep moisture lotion among the Vaseline lotions.

Its price is higher if I purchase from market as compared to amazon so I always order it from Amazon and product quality and packaging never disappoints me.
If your skin is rough then go for it.

I have been using several other moisturizer over the period of time and I can for sure say that Aveeno is the best among all. After a week+ use my skin is well moisturized and doesn't have the white patches anymore. It's a bit expensive, but it's worth spending on this as you will get the result that you have been looking for all these while!! Go for it!

Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Lotion, 354 ml (Bottle might vary),3.0 out of 5 stars,I haven‚Äôt use the product but I did use it earlier and it was very nice. Product‚Äôs look has changed, so will see if the effects are remaining same or not.
Worst packaging, seller should have common sense to think that it could leak, so they should have done proper packaging, but they packed it like a cloth piece, just under a paper cover and as a result I received a broken and damaged product, I have urgency to use it so I managed somehow otherwise I would have returned it.

WOW Skin Science Shea Butter With Lactic Acid Body Lotion | Hydrates Very Dry Skin | Long Lasting 48 hrs Moisturization | Smoothens Rough, Flaky Skin | Calms Itchy Skin - 400ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the WOW Skin Science Shea Butter and Cocoa Butter Moisturizing Body Lotion, and I must say it has been a game-changer for my dry skin! This product deserves all the praise it can get. Let me share my experience with you.

First and foremost, the packaging is simple yet elegant. The pump dispenser makes it convenient to use and ensures there's no wastage. Kudos to WOW Skin Science for their attention to detail.

Upon applying the lotion, I was immediately greeted by a heavenly scent of shea butter and cocoa butter. It's a rich and soothing fragrance that instantly uplifts my mood. The consistency of the lotion is perfect‚Äînot too thick or runny‚Äîand it spreads smoothly over my skin, making the application effortless.

What truly sets this body lotion apart is its exceptional moisturizing power. My skin tends to get dry and flaky, especially during the colder months, but this lotion has worked wonders in restoring hydration and leaving my skin feeling silky-smooth. It absorbs quickly without any greasy residue, which is fantastic since I can get dressed immediately after application.

The formulation of shea butter and cocoa butter is a winning combination. Not only do they provide intense hydration, but they also nourish and rejuvenate the skin, making it appear more radiant and healthy. I've noticed a significant improvement in the texture and suppleness of my skin since I started using this lotion.

Moreover, I appreciate that WOW Skin Science prioritizes natural ingredients and avoids harsh chemicals. This body lotion is free from parabens, sulfates, mineral oils, and other harmful additives. It's reassuring to know that I'm using a product that cares for my skin's health.

In terms of value for money, WOW Skin Science delivers yet again. The bottle is generously sized, and a little goes a long way, so it lasts for quite some time. Considering the quality and effectiveness of the product, I find it to be reasonably priced and worth every penny.

To sum it up, the WOW Skin Science Shea Butter and Cocoa Butter Moisturizing Body Lotion is a top-notch product that I highly recommend to anyone seeking intense hydration and nourishment for their skin. It ticks all the boxes‚Äîfrom the luxurious fragrance to the effective moisturizing properties and the use of natural ingredients.

Tried to take pictures. But as the bottle is darkbrown coloured and bottleneck is narrow, it is difficult to get clear picture.

Anyways, this is my last Wow purchase. Don't trust a company that cheats.
Don't buy if you don't want to get cheated.

WOW Skin Science Shea Butter With Lactic Acid Body Lotion | Hydrates Very Dry Skin | Long Lasting 48 hrs Moisturization | Smoothens Rough, Flaky Skin | Calms Itchy Skin - 400ml,1.0 out of 5 stars,The bottle I receivesd was half empty. It felt so light the moment I received that, I doubted the amount in the bottle and opened to check. There was only a little more than 1/4th of the bottle filled.

Tried to take pictures. But as the bottle is darkbrown coloured and bottleneck is narrow, it is difficult to get clear picture.

Anyways, this is my last Wow purchase. Don't trust a company that cheats.
Don't buy if you don't want to get cheated.

All the marks were gone! I tried another brand at a cheaper cost and the purging was just too much and skin didn‚Äôt improve much.

Minimalist 10% Niacinamide Face Serum for Acne Marks, Blemishes & Oil Balancing with Zinc | Skin Clarifying Anti Acne Serum for Oily & Acne Prone Skin (30 ml (Pack of 1)),5.0 out of 5 stars,This serum, and Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin serum are my new favorites. I bought both to combat sun damage on my face, since my face was super tan in comparison to my neck. At first, I didn't feel like I saw much of a difference, but after really staring at my face today, I think it actually helped lift my face a couple shades! The tan hasn't completely gone, but my face is definitely lighter. However, that's not the reason I love these 2 serums so much. Using them in combination with prescription tretinoin has made my skin SO SMOOTH!! The tretinoin alone helped some stuff, but using it with this made my skin glowy and smooth. I am in my early 20s, and I started noticing the formation of early wrinkles. Not quite deep set yet, so they were still treatable. They bugged me a lot, but once I started using this stuff, my wrinkles went away! I was shocked! Not to mention a lot of the dull texture in my skin is gone. Now my skin looks so plump and soft.

I also really love the packaging. The bottle comes in a box, that's in another box, so it's well protected. The bottle is also made of UV blocking glass, and the label has anything and everything you need to know about the product, including the pH, and what to combine with it. Plus, I love how affordable it is. I'm definitely gonna be buying more of this in the future, and I highly recommend it üòç

Worth all the hype, provides intense hydration like no other moisturizer can give. I could describe it as one reason for my glass skin!
Although I have combination skin, I think this will work the best for dry skin and acne prone skin. However, give it a try as each skin is different and it may not suit everyone.

It really is fantastic. The texture is a bit viscous but not unpleasant and the results are definitely noticably softer, hydrated skin. Almost no scent at all. Bottle lasts a while. Definitely a permanent addition to my routine. I will buy again and intend try more products in this line.

COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence 3.38 fl.oz 100ml, Hydrating Serum for Face with Snail Secretion Filtrate for Dull Skin & Fine Lines, Korean Skincare,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the past several years I have had moderate redness on my cheeks and chin, even with using gentle cleansers and moisturizing. My mom has rosacea so it's possible that's in my genes. I always had to cover up this redness with concealer but it bummed me out that I didn't feel confident without makeup on. Fast forward to buying this product and using it for about a month-- my inflammation/red patches are basically gone and my skin tone is so much more even! Another huge plus: because this product has drastically reduced the inflammation, it has also reduced the appearance of the red pigmentation from my acne scars. They look WAY less pronounced now and I'm amazed! Using this product has really increased my confidence when leaving the house without makeup. My skin looks healthier and is more moisturized. It is also an excellent addition to my morning gua sha routine because of its slippery texture. I use the product twice a day on my face and neck and am SO happy it has made such a difference in my skin... Buy it!!

COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence 3.38 fl.oz 100ml, Hydrating Serum for Face with Snail Secretion Filtrate for Dull Skin & Fine Lines, Korean Skincare,5.0 out of 5 stars,It gives the skin it's softness. Stickiness wise it is great but does not last for a long time(one of the good things). Keeps our skin very much hydrated and gives our skin the exact glow required.

COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence 3.38 fl.oz 100ml, Hydrating Serum for Face with Snail Secretion Filtrate for Dull Skin & Fine Lines, Korean Skincare,5.0 out of 5 stars,I‚Äôve been using the COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence for a while now, and I‚Äôm genuinely impressed with the results. This hydrating serum, enriched with snail secretion filtrate, has been excellent for rejuvenating my dull skin and minimizing fine lines.

For the price, this product offers remarkable value. The quality and effectiveness of the essence make it a standout in my skincare routine. It‚Äôs a great option for those looking to address skin dullness and signs of aging without breaking the bank. Highly recommended!

COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence 3.38 fl.oz 100ml, Hydrating Serum for Face with Snail Secretion Filtrate for Dull Skin & Fine Lines, Korean Skincare,5.0 out of 5 stars,Was skeptical about the authenticity of the product but I can confirm that I have received the original product. Worth all the hype, provides intense hydration like no other moisturizer can give. I could describe it as one reason for my glass skin!
Although I have combination skin, I think this will work the best for dry skin and acne prone skin. However, give it a try as each skin is different and it may not suit everyone.

It really is fantastic. The texture is a bit viscous but not unpleasant and the results are definitely noticably softer, hydrated skin. Almost no scent at all. Bottle lasts a while. Definitely a permanent addition to my routine. I will buy again and intend try more products in this line.

COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence 3.38 fl.oz 100ml, Hydrating Serum for Face with Snail Secretion Filtrate for Dull Skin & Fine Lines, Korean Skincare,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the past several years I have had moderate redness on my cheeks and chin, even with using gentle cleansers and moisturizing. My mom has rosacea so it's possible that's in my genes. I always had to cover up this redness with concealer but it bummed me out that I didn't feel confident without makeup on. Fast forward to buying this product and using it for about a month-- my inflammation/red patches are basically gone and my skin tone is so much more even! Another huge plus: because this product has drastically reduced the inflammation, it has also reduced the appearance of the red pigmentation from my acne scars. They look WAY less pronounced now and I'm amazed! Using this product has really increased my confidence when leaving the house without makeup. My skin looks healthier and is more moisturized. It is also an excellent addition to my morning gua sha routine because of its slippery texture. I use the product twice a day on my face and neck and am SO happy it has made such a difference in my skin... Buy it!!

,I received my guasha tool with a crack on the side that slides along the skin, which could potentially cause scratches and skin damage. Additionally, the roller was dislocated from the rod, and I had to fix it myself. The packaging was very unsatisfactory, with holes along the corners.

Minimalist 2% Salicylic Acid Serum For Acne, Blackheads & Open Pores | Reduces Excess Oil & Bumpy Texture | BHA Based Exfoliant for Acne Prone or Oily Skin | 30ml,1.0 out of 5 stars,I firstly didn't like the quality of the product. Totally exorbitant and no value for money. My skin was way way better before I started using this product. It will cause allergy and redden your skin, erode the moisture from it even if you use it twice or thrice a week. It won't help in blackheads, acne or oily skin in any manner. The texture of the skin is in no way better.
It would've been better had I bought another vitamin C serum instead of this.
A complete hype.

Minimalist 10% Vitamin C Face Serum for Glowing Skin (Formulated & Tested For Sensitive Skin) | Non Irritating | Non Sticky | Brightening Vit C Formula For Men and Women | 30 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Minimalist 10% Vitamin C Face Serum for a month, and I'm thrilled with the results. My skin looks brighter and more radiant. The lightweight, non-greasy formula absorbs quickly without any residue. It has significantly improved my skin texture and reduced dark spots.

This serum has become an essential part of my skincare routine. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to enhance their skin's appearance.

One piece of advice is not to go into sunlight immediately after applying it, apply sunscreen or some UV++ protection.

Minimalist 10% Vitamin C Face Serum for Glowing Skin (Formulated & Tested For Sensitive Skin) | Non Irritating | Non Sticky | Brightening Vit C Formula For Men and Women | 30 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,I just had to share my experience with the Minimalist Vitamin C serum. It's seriously been a game-changer for my skin! I used to struggle with uneven skin texture and dark spots, but since I started using this serum, my skin has transformed. It's become so much smoother and clearer, and those pesky dark spots have faded away. My skin now has this amazing shiny and radiant look that I absolutely love. The best part? I've actually stopped wearing as much makeup since I started using this serum. It's that good! It's not sticky at all, which is a big plus for me. The serum absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving any residue or tackiness. It's lightweight and comfortable to wear, making it perfect for both morning and evening use. The performance is top-notch too. The packaging has a tight seal to keep the product fresh, and the consistency is just right, not too thick or runny. Overall, it's a fantastic product that I highly recommend trying out! üòäüåü
,Just Herbs Lip and Cheek Tint for the third time, and let me tell you, I'm absolutely loving it! The shade 06pink forever is just perfect, and what's even better is that it's super easy to carry around. Now, let's talk about the texture. It's so smooth and lightweight, making it a breeze to apply on both my lips and cheeks. The color payoff is fantastic too. It gives a natural flush to my cheeks and a subtle tint to my lips, which is exactly what I was looking for. One thing I really appreciate about this product is the packaging. It's compact and travel-friendly, making it convenient to take with me wherever I go. I've also noticed that it feels moisturizing on my lips, which is a huge bonus. If I had to mention any downsides, it Tint doesn't have the longest staying power, so I find myself reapplying it. But the great thing about it being made with natural ingredients is that you can feel good about putting it on your skin more often.So, even though it may not last as long as we'd hope, at least we can enjoy its natural goodness without any worries. Overall, I highly recommend the Just Herbs Lip and Cheek Tint in the shade 06pink forever.

Minimalist 10% Vitamin C Face Serum for Glowing Skin (Formulated & Tested For Sensitive Skin) | Non Irritating | Non Sticky | Brightening Vit C Formula For Men and Women | 30 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my second Vit C I‚Äôm using, the first one from Skin+me was much more expensive (or should I say overpriced) but this one is just as excellent if not better. The serum itself is quite runny. It brightens my skin and makes it firmer. I have rosacea (it doesn‚Äôt trigger it) and my skin is prone to hyperpigmentation hence why I was recommended vit C serum. I only use it in the morning because I‚Äôm not sure how to combine it in the evening with my active ingredient cream. I will be definitely looking at other products from the minimalist.

Minimalist 10% Vitamin C Face Serum for Glowing Skin (Formulated & Tested For Sensitive Skin) | Non Irritating | Non Sticky | Brightening Vit C Formula For Men and Women | 30 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thanks for this product it did what it claimed to do.
,Very true there is no change to my skin none at all.
Minimalist 10% Vitamin C Face Serum for Glowing Skin (Formulated & Tested For Sensitive Skin) | Non Irritating | Non Sticky | Brightening Vit C Formula For Men and Women | 30 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my second Vit C I‚Äôm using, the first one from Skin+me was much more expensive (or should I say overpriced) but this one is just as excellent if not better. The serum itself is quite runny. It brightens my skin and makes it firmer. I have rosacea (it doesn‚Äôt trigger it) and my skin is prone to hyperpigmentation hence why I was recommended vit C serum. I only use it in the morning because I‚Äôm not sure how to combine it in the evening with my active ingredient cream. I will be definitely looking at other products from the minimalist.

**Visible Results:**
Since incorporating this serum into my routine, I've noticed a significant improvement in my skin's overall glow and texture. My complexion looks more radiant, and the appearance of dark spots has visibly reduced. It's truly a confidence booster!

Many people who have used it say it works well to fade dark spots and give skin a nice glow.
It has an ingredient called salicylic acid that helps get rid of dead skin cells. This can make your skin feel smoother. Just keep in mind, when you first start using it, your skin might feel a bit oily. That's normal and happens because the serum is cleaning out your pores.
Some people noticed their skin got better after about a month of using the serum regularly. But don't worry if it takes a bit longer for you. Everyone's skin is different! It's important to be patient and give the serum time to work its magic.
The serum feels light on your skin and doesn't make it feel sticky, which is great. It can also help make your skin feel soft and supple.
One thing to know is that the way you put the serum on your skin could be better. But for the price, many people think it's a good product to try if you want to make your skin look brighter and more even.
Just remember, if you have dry skin, it might help to only wash your face once a day and use a toner before putting on the serum. And if your skin feels irritated at first, try using the serum every other day instead of every day.
Overall, Garnier's Vitamin C Serum seems to be a helpful product for getting brighter, more even-looking skin. With a little time and patience, it might be just what you need for a glowing complexion!

The Derma Co 10% Vitamin C Face Serum I With Vitamin C, 5% Niacinamide & Hyaluronic Acid I For Skin Radiance I Day + Night Regimen | Suitable For All Skin Types- 30ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Derma Co 10% Vitamin C Face Serum with Vitamin C, 5% Niacinamide & Hyaluronic Acid has truly transformed my skincare routine, delivering exceptional results that speak volumes about its efficacy and quality. As someone who's always on the lookout for skincare products that deliver visible results, I can confidently say that this serum lives up to its promises.

First and foremost, let's talk about the ingredients. With a potent blend of 10% Vitamin C, 5% Niacinamide, and Hyaluronic Acid, this serum is a powerhouse of skin-loving nutrients. Vitamin C is renowned for its brightening properties, helping to fade dark spots, even out skin tone, and impart a radiant glow. Niacinamide complements Vitamin C by reducing inflammation, minimizing pores, and enhancing skin texture, while Hyaluronic Acid provides intense hydration, leaving the skin plump and supple.

The texture of the serum is lightweight and absorbs effortlessly into the skin, leaving behind no greasy residue. I appreciate that it is suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin, as it is free from harsh chemicals, parabens, and sulfates. It's also cruelty-free, which aligns with my values as a conscious consumer.

After incorporating this serum into my daily skincare routine, I noticed a remarkable improvement in the overall appearance and texture of my skin. My complexion appeared brighter, more even-toned, and youthful. Stubborn dark spots and acne scars began to fade, and my skin felt noticeably smoother and more hydrated.

Another aspect I love about The Derma Co Vitamin C Face Serum is its versatility. Whether used alone as a targeted treatment or layered with other skincare products, it seamlessly integrates into my routine, allowing me to customize my skincare regimen according to my skin's needs.

In terms of value for money, the quality and effectiveness of this serum far exceed its price point. The 30ml bottle may seem small, but a little goes a long way, and the results are undeniably worth it.

Overall, I highly recommend The Derma Co 10% Vitamin C Face Serum to anyone looking to rejuvenate their skin and achieve a radiant complexion. With its powerful blend of ingredients and proven results, it has become a staple in my skincare arsenal, and I can't imagine my routine without it.

The Derma Co 10% Niacinamide Face Serum For Acne Marks & Acne Prone Skin For Unisex, 10ml (Dermaco),4.0 out of 5 stars,When used as part of a daily skincare routine, niacinamide may help calm the skin, reduce transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and increase hydration in the skin's uppermost layer. This makes niacinamide a beneficial skincare ingredient for those looking to promote hydrated, smooth, and even-toned skin.

Minimalist 2% Alpha Arbutin Serum for Pigmentation & Dark Spots Removal | Anti-pigmentation Face Serum with Hyaluronic Acid to Remove Blemishes, Acne Marks & Tanning | 30 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is a must try serum. Works so well and so fast, it is great for pigmentation you can start seeing changes within a week. I would suggest using it only at night after cleansing and toner. It has a very light texture and also moisturizes your skin. 2-3 drops are enough. It has a little chemical smell but not strong. It is worth buying. üëç

Minimalist 2% Alpha Arbutin Serum for Pigmentation & Dark Spots Removal | Anti-pigmentation Face Serum with Hyaluronic Acid to Remove Blemishes, Acne Marks & Tanning | 30 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,Let me first tell you that I am a skeptic and I was quite reluctant to try to try it out as I have a very sensitive skin and I have to think 100 times before trying out a product.

But my experience with Minimalist's sunscreen was fantastic and I was still struggling with a lot of pigmentation so I gave it a shot, scared.

Lo and behold, after the first use I could see the difference. Although I gave myself the benefit of doubt and considered it to be Placebo.

Almost a week after trying, I can now confidently say it has worked. It has worked really well on my skin.

There was a stubborn sun tan mark on my forehead for about an year and pigmentation on my nose for almost 5-7 years. Both the marks have faded about 70-80% after 10 days of regular use.

I don't follow a routine, I simply clean my face with a face wash and apply the serum BEFORE sleeping and wash it off in the morning so I leave it there for a good 6-8 hours everyday.

If you are wondering whether you should try it or not, purchase the smaller one (10 ml) which is what I did and then if it works, go ahead with the bigger bottle.

Try it out yourself, I don't usually write reviews but this was worth my time and money so leaving it here for your reference.

If it feels like I was paid to write this review, skip this one and read others because no way in hell I can prove that I was not.

All the best, happy skin care! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Minimalist 2% Alpha Arbutin Serum for Pigmentation & Dark Spots Removal | Anti-pigmentation Face Serum with Hyaluronic Acid to Remove Blemishes, Acne Marks & Tanning | 30 ml,3.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this 3-4 months ago. I am using this during night skincare routine, 4 times a week. I have pigmentation around the lips which have lightened a little bit after 4 months usage. The bottle quantity will go for another 1 month before it's get finished. Pros- Gives me a soft skin and a healthy glow in the morning. If I skip this serum in the night skincare routine, my face looks a bit dull in the morning. So for me definitely this serum helps to give that healthy glow in the morning.
Cons- very slow effect on pigmentation & dark spots. You can't even notice the difference if you don't compare the before-and-after 4 months images.

It's a good product but it burns my skin a little (maybe bcuz I have extremely sensitive skin) and I can smell the chemical fragrance a bit.
It does makes your skin better, so it's definitely wasn't a waste of money.
The burning was also not much of an inconvenience bcuz it would go away soon after applying the moisturiser

Minimalist 16% Vitamin C Face Serum (Advanced) With Vit E, & Ferulic Acid For Glowing Skin | Advanced Brightening Formula With Power of Vit C & E, Ferulic Acid & Fullerenes | 20ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a well-formulated 15% EAA serum, most EAA serums are waterless using propanediol as a base the result is a sticky formula which I found comedogenic. e.g. the sticky formulas were Ordinary, Niod and facetheory, in all of these cases I threw the product away within 1-2 weeks.
This is a water-based EAA that is fast absorbing, non-comedogenic and gentle. I had no stinging sensation despite the use of tretinoin 0.05% three times a week in the evening. I use the vitamin C in the morning.
My main issue is result is slower than with L-ascorbic, but that is for all derivatives of vitamin C, so you need to be patient.
I used this product on its own for about two weeks, but I have started layering it over the G and G 15% LAA. This combo is giving me brightness and glow. I layer because I find 15% LAA does not take care of the hyperpigmentation like 20% LAA.
In my opinion, EAA is the best derivative so far, 2nd option is SAP.

Cons :
Since they already have a 10% EAA, why not make a 20% EAA instead 15% EAA
20mls is just too small - will get less than one month of use if using daily

This is the best EAA formulation. I have purchased 2nd bottle, and will purchase my 3rd to have as a backup

I have used started using this product not knowing what it would do but the the change was immediate. I could see my skin much more glowy and glass skin type.

Minimalist 16% Vitamin C Face Serum (Advanced) With Vit E, & Ferulic Acid For Glowing Skin | Advanced Brightening Formula With Power of Vit C & E, Ferulic Acid & Fullerenes | 20ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a well-formulated 15% EAA serum, most EAA serums are waterless using propanediol as a base the result is a sticky formula which I found comedogenic. e.g. the sticky formulas were Ordinary, Niod and facetheory, in all of these cases I threw the product away within 1-2 weeks.
This is a water-based EAA that is fast absorbing, non-comedogenic and gentle. I had no stinging sensation despite the use of tretinoin 0.05% three times a week in the evening. I use the vitamin C in the morning.
My main issue is result is slower than with L-ascorbic, but that is for all derivatives of vitamin C, so you need to be patient.
I used this product on its own for about two weeks, but I have started layering it over the G and G 15% LAA. This combo is giving me brightness and glow. I layer because I find 15% LAA does not take care of the hyperpigmentation like 20% LAA.
In my opinion, EAA is the best derivative so far, 2nd option is SAP.

Cons :
Since they already have a 10% EAA, why not make a 20% EAA instead 15% EAA
20mls is just too small - will get less than one month of use if using daily

This is the best EAA formulation. I have purchased 2nd bottle, and will purchase my 3rd to have as a backup

The Derma Co 2% Salicylic Acid Serum | Witch Hazel & Willow Bark | For Active Acne I Controls Sebum Production & Prevents Skin Damage I BHA Based Exfoliant for Acne Prone & Oily Skin ‚Äì 30ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great on my skin, this is the 2nd time I ordered it. It lasts very long and I did got rid of my pimples and blackheads after using it. My skin looks and feels great! It has value for money and works wonders. Really happy with the results. But before recommending I would like to make a strong point that this product doesn‚Äôt works on everyone‚Äôs skin. On some people it doesn‚Äôt suits well or ends up disturbing their skin barrier. So it‚Äôs better if you try a small patch on my hand/wrist first and check how it goes or try introducing it in your skincare routine slowly like twice a week and then increase the amount slowly when it starts adjusting to your skin.
You will find a lot of information regarding that on youtube or anywhere on the internet so always order after a through research! But if you are like me whose skin can adjust easily then its a must try!

The Derma Co 2% Salicylic Acid Serum | Witch Hazel & Willow Bark | For Active Acne I Controls Sebum Production & Prevents Skin Damage I BHA Based Exfoliant for Acne Prone & Oily Skin ‚Äì 30ml,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Derma Co 2% Salicylic Acid Serum with Witch Hazel & Willow Bark is a decent option for addressing active acne. The 2% salicylic acid concentration helps to exfoliate the skin and unclog pores, potentially reducing breakouts over time. The addition of witch hazel and willow bark adds some soothing properties, which can be beneficial for calming irritated skin. However, the 10ml size is relatively small, so it may not last long with regular use. While it delivers noticeable results, especially for those with mild to moderate acne, it may not be as potent as higher-strength treatments for more severe cases. Overall, it‚Äôs a good addition to an acne regimen but might require supplementing with other products for more significant results.

The Derma Co 2% Salicylic Acid Serum | Witch Hazel & Willow Bark | For Active Acne I Controls Sebum Production & Prevents Skin Damage I BHA Based Exfoliant for Acne Prone & Oily Skin ‚Äì 30ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have been using this serum from may of 2023 and all I can say about it is it's absolutely worth the money !!

At first I used to apply it once a week in my pm routine as I was scared how it would react to my skin (sensitive combination skin.)

So now, i did not instantly have the CLEAREST skin instead I had more texture and bumpy skin, my skin was filled with tiny little bumps (it's common for me, I breakout like this on my skin from time to time)

I was scared and wanted to stop using it but the internet said it's common and continued use would help me see better results.

I used it for quite a while and then my skin cleared up, I increased the frequency of application.

I applied it two times a week and it did improve my complexion and skin texture and helped clear my skin a bit but it did not and still has not done anything for my blackheads and whiteheads. ( I used pore stips and now my nose has become oilier :/ )

Once again, I now applied it everyday (except a few skip days because I'm lazy) and I see IMMENSE jump in my skin health, it was so bumpy, textury, dull, etc but now my skin looks healthy although it still needs time to clear out because I recently had bad acne but the serum really does work like it's my first active that I'm using so I'm just real happy with my results ngl it just makes your skin clear, and you GLOW like a light bulb also the smell at first was noticeable and ew for me but now I'm accustomed to it so it smells like nothing and the serum absorps pretty well and quickly into the skin too.

ITS A PLUSSS

You should always patch test before using it although I didn't i was so excited when I received it that I jumped into application.

And I did buy it after a lot of research, watching reviews on YouTube, nykaa, Amazon, reading articles, and rethinking about a 100 times but it's all worth it bestie buy it now !!

Note: it gets just a TINY bit sticky-ish after you apply but after you let it absorb it's all nice and you look cute ;) and OBVIOUSLY SUNSCREEN I still only use it at night so next day I make SURE that I absolutely HAVE MY SUNSCREEN ON BEFORE I STEP OUT FOR BATTLE ü¶∏‚òÄÔ∏è

I started by trying L'Or√©al's older dark spot cream, then ran out and they don't sell it anymore so I found this. Much better anyway! Within 3 days the freckles on my forehead were Duchess noticeable! Loving it. Not a fan of fragrance in my facial products, but it doesn't aggravate my sensitive skin.

This serum has quickly become an essential part of my daily skincare routine. Over time, the serum has significantly reduced the appearance of my pores and also reduced the dark spots. It is perfect for my sensitive skin.

One of the standout features of this serum is its lightweight, non-greasy formula. It absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling refreshed and never oily.

I highly recommend it to anyone looking to achieve a brighter, more even complexion with the added benefits of niacinamide. This serum is perfect for a sensitive skin.

Minimalist 5% Niacinamide Face Serum for Clear Glowing Skin, Reduces Dullness, Hydrates & Repairs Skin with Vit B3 & Hyaluronic Acid, Day & Night Serum for Dry & Sensitive Skin, For Women & Men,30 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's perfect for people like me who have oily , acne prone skin along with hyperpigmentation .
It works wonders for your skin .
The thing that I love about this product is that it doesn't have any fragrance and it's transparent in colour, as it does not contain artificial fragrance it doesn't irritate the skin .

You will start seeing the results if you have mild acne problems . It showed great results in just 1 week . I usually order 10 % niacinmide but by mistake I ordered 5 % niacinamide and was bit skeptical it it will work on my skin the way 10% niacinmide does but guess what it's amazing .
It also helps that it has hyaluronic acid which as we all know helps in hydrating our skin and slowly repairing it .
Niacinamide also helped with my acne marks which are light after continuously using it .
I would suggest to use niacinmide in the along with moisturizer and sunscreen ( it's important , I used to think it doesn't matter, but it does ).
In the evening salicylic acid and moisturizer.

Having skincare is important .

I am 43 with oily skin. No scars or texture issues. I had nice skin to begin with. When I meet new people they think I‚Äôm 29-31. So I definitely came with an advantage. But you can definitely see a difference in clarity and overall evenness now. Also it helps with some of the light darkening spots I got with electrolysis. This is now part of my forever skin care.

Minimalist 5% Niacinamide Face Serum for Clear Glowing Skin, Reduces Dullness, Hydrates & Repairs Skin with Vit B3 & Hyaluronic Acid, Day & Night Serum for Dry & Sensitive Skin, For Women & Men,30 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's perfect for people like me who have oily , acne prone skin along with hyperpigmentation .
It works wonders for your skin .
The thing that I love about this product is that it doesn't have any fragrance and it's transparent in colour, as it does not contain artificial fragrance it doesn't irritate the skin .

You will start seeing the results if you have mild acne problems . It showed great results in just 1 week . I usually order 10 % niacinmide but by mistake I ordered 5 % niacinamide and was bit skeptical it it will work on my skin the way 10% niacinmide does but guess what it's amazing .
It also helps that it has hyaluronic acid which as we all know helps in hydrating our skin and slowly repairing it .
Niacinamide also helped with my acne marks which are light after continuously using it .
I would suggest to use niacinmide in the along with moisturizer and sunscreen ( it's important , I used to think it doesn't matter, but it does ).
In the evening salicylic acid and moisturizer.

Having skincare is important .

Minimalist 5% Niacinamide Face Serum for Clear Glowing Skin, Reduces Dullness, Hydrates & Repairs Skin with Vit B3 & Hyaluronic Acid, Day & Night Serum for Dry & Sensitive Skin, For Women & Men,30 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well maybe that‚Äôs an exaggeration but within a few weeks of daily use I was getting compliments from all my friends about how perfect my skin looks. I am 43 with oily skin. No scars or texture issues. I had nice skin to begin with. When I meet new people they think I‚Äôm 29-31. So I definitely came with an advantage. But you can definitely see a difference in clarity and overall evenness now. Also it helps with some of the light darkening spots I got with electrolysis. This is now part of my forever skin care. I am locked in. I‚Äôm trying 10% next

,The quality is very bad. The glass broke in no time
Minimalist 0.3% Retinol Face Serum For Anti Aging For Beginners | Night Face Serum With Retinol & Q10 To Reduce Fine Lines & Wrinkles | For Women & Men (30 ml),5.0 out of 5 stars,This product works. Anyone who decides to use Retinol should definitely do some research (I recommend the YouTube channel Doctorly) before using the product. I‚Äôve seen some criticisms in the reviews here about breakouts and people finding the formula to be too oily. I‚Äôll try and address both points here:
1. Your face will probably break out when you first start using Retinol. The product increases the cell turnover of your skin, leading to something called ‚Äúpurging‚Äù. Trust me, stick it out for at least a month or two, and you‚Äôll see the benefits.
Of course, any redness or breakouts could also be a sign of a bad reaction to Retinol. You‚Äôll know that‚Äôs the case of you see breakouts in parts of your face that normally don‚Äôt have acne. If that‚Äôs the case, just reduce the frequency of Retinol usage in the first months (once every two or three days should do) and sandwich the product between layers of a moisturiser.
2. The formula IS oil-based. It has to be for the active ingredient to be stable. I understand that it feels weird going to bed with your skin looking oily, but just trust the process. And if you really feel like it‚Äôs leaving your face feeling too greasy, reduce the amount of product that you‚Äôre using (5-7 drops is more than enough to cover the face and neck)

My only criticism about the product has to do with the packaging. It would be really good if Minimalist started putting seals on their boxes, so that the consumers can be assured that the product they‚Äôve purchased hasn‚Äôt been tampered with.

Bio-Oil Original Skincare Oil suitable for Stretch Marks | Scar Removal | Uneven Skin Tone | Vitamin E | All Skin Types | 60ml,1.0 out of 5 stars,Just see the product ingredients..they are using banned chemicals..

Botanicals
Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract (Calendula Oil)
Lavandula Angustifolia Oil (Lavender Oil)
Rosmarinus Officinalis Leaf Oil (Rosemary Oil)
Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil (Chamomile Oil)

Vitamins
Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A)
Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E)

Oil base
Paraffinum Liquidum - This is a crude oil, liquid paraffin. When you use it, you're basically applying liquid fuel to the skin. It may feel good on the skin as these products often do because they are an occlusive and provide that barrier. This, really, though, serves no benefit to the skin and there are many better natural oils on the market.
Triisononanoin
Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate
Isopropyl Myristate
Glycine Soja Oil
Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil
BHT ‚Äì Chances are you have heard of a toxic chemical being removed from many nail polishes on the market called toluene. BHT is essentially substituted toluene. It is harmful. According to the National Library of Medicine HazMap, BHT is considered to me a "known immune system toxicant." Animal studies have also shown that in low doses, that BHT causes negative effects to the brain and nervous system. This study was published by the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry in 1980 and has yet to be refuted. There is a host of bans and restrictions on BHT across the globe, yet it is still used here. What troubles me most is that Bio-Oil is used by many pregnant women on stretch marks and one has to wonder about the effect it may have on unborn children.
Bisabolo

Fragrance (Rose)
Parfum - artificial fragrances like this are the leading cause of skin reactions
Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone Amyl Cinnamal - highly allergenic, fragrance ingredient is an alcohol, even though the label doesn't say "amyl cinnamal alcohol" as it should. Also a known toxicant to the immune system in humans.
Benzyl Salicylate - UV absorber. Does have salicylic acid as a component, which is not to be used by pregnant women.
Citronellol
Coumarin - You may not be familiar with the name Coumarin, but are probably familiar with itsrelatives, Coumadin or Warfarin, blood thinning medication and Tonka Bean, a fragrance ingredient. In high doses, all can be lethal. Coumarin is found in the seeds of the Tonka Bean. Coumarin is on the EU' list of banned and/or restricted ingredients and several studies have shown there to be many systemic effects in low doses. To think that this is in here and may very well be absorbed into the bloodstream is very alarming, especially since there are links to cancer. This is found in this product as a fragrance ingredient.
Eugenol - a denaturant and fragrance component. Highly toxic. On the EU's banned/restricted list. The National Library of Medicine HazMap calls this a "known human immune system toxicant."
Farnesol
Geraniol - Masking fragrance, toning agent. Known to be a strong toxin; banned or restricted in other countries; a known environmental toxin Hydroxycitronellal -Yet another masking fragrance! A known immune system toxicant; also banned or restricted in the EU and other areas Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde
Limonene - skin sensitizer; for perfume. Restricted/banned in other countries
Linalool -Masking fragrance; shown to be hazardous, banned/restricted for use in other countries

Color
Orange: CI 26100 (Red 17) - This is officially classified by the FDA as a red colorant (Red 225) and data has shown this to have bioaccumulative effects and would not be considered eco-friendly by any stretch.

Bio-Oil Original Skincare Oil suitable for Stretch Marks | Scar Removal | Uneven Skin Tone | Vitamin E | All Skin Types | 60ml,1.0 out of 5 stars,Just see the product ingredients..they are using banned chemicals..

Botanicals
Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract (Calendula Oil)
Lavandula Angustifolia Oil (Lavender Oil)
Rosmarinus Officinalis Leaf Oil (Rosemary Oil)
Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil (Chamomile Oil)

Vitamins
Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A)
Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E)

Oil base
Paraffinum Liquidum - This is a crude oil, liquid paraffin. When you use it, you're basically applying liquid fuel to the skin. It may feel good on the skin as these products often do because they are an occlusive and provide that barrier. This, really, though, serves no benefit to the skin and there are many better natural oils on the market.
Triisononanoin
Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate
Isopropyl Myristate
Glycine Soja Oil
Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil
BHT ‚Äì Chances are you have heard of a toxic chemical being removed from many nail polishes on the market called toluene. BHT is essentially substituted toluene. It is harmful. According to the National Library of Medicine HazMap, BHT is considered to me a "known immune system toxicant." Animal studies have also shown that in low doses, that BHT causes negative effects to the brain and nervous system. This study was published by the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry in 1980 and has yet to be refuted. There is a host of bans and restrictions on BHT across the globe, yet it is still used here. What troubles me most is that Bio-Oil is used by many pregnant women on stretch marks and one has to wonder about the effect it may have on unborn children.
Bisabolo

Fragrance (Rose)
Parfum - artificial fragrances like this are the leading cause of skin reactions
Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone Amyl Cinnamal - highly allergenic, fragrance ingredient is an alcohol, even though the label doesn't say "amyl cinnamal alcohol" as it should. Also a known toxicant to the immune system in humans.
Benzyl Salicylate - UV absorber. Does have salicylic acid as a component, which is not to be used by pregnant women.
Citronellol
Coumarin - You may not be familiar with the name Coumarin, but are probably familiar with itsrelatives, Coumadin or Warfarin, blood thinning medication and Tonka Bean, a fragrance ingredient. In high doses, all can be lethal. Coumarin is found in the seeds of the Tonka Bean. Coumarin is on the EU' list of banned and/or restricted ingredients and several studies have shown there to be many systemic effects in low doses. To think that this is in here and may very well be absorbed into the bloodstream is very alarming, especially since there are links to cancer. This is found in this product as a fragrance ingredient.
Eugenol - a denaturant and fragrance component. Highly toxic. On the EU's banned/restricted list. The National Library of Medicine HazMap calls this a "known human immune system toxicant."
Farnesol
Geraniol - Masking fragrance, toning agent. Known to be a strong toxin; banned or restricted in other countries; a known environmental toxin Hydroxycitronellal -Yet another masking fragrance! A known immune system toxicant; also banned or restricted in the EU and other areas Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde
Limonene - skin sensitizer; for perfume. Restricted/banned in other countries
Linalool -Masking fragrance; shown to be hazardous, banned/restricted for use in other countries

Color
Orange: CI 26100 (Red 17) - This is officially classified by the FDA as a red colorant (Red 225) and data has shown this to have bioaccumulative effects and would not be considered eco-friendly by any stretch.

I was looking for something that would make my face glow and came across the vitamin c and e skin care products by the brand. So, I purchased their face wash, toner, this serum, the vitamin c and e moisturizer along with their sunscreen. Basically, all the products in vitamin c and e range üòÖ
First of all, I just love their packaging. It's so cute! Next, I found that for 30 ml it has quite a good quantity available and then the most important thing is, it actually works. I incorporated these products in my morning routine. On the first two to three days my skin got some redness and even broke out a bit in the chin area. But understanding that it will take some time for my skin to adjust, I continued to use the serum along with the rest of the products. In the first week itself my skin adjusted and after 15 days of use, the results are just wow. There is actually a real glow on my face and I am very satisfied.

I had been using this product from last 8mnths and always had gotten the one with the thicker consistency but this one that i had brought has a different bottle ie different color tone,a longer bottle with a different manufacturer and batch no.(may be the company changed the same).
I am sceptical about the new product and hope it works the same way. Previously I thaught may be it is because of the temp. but I had some amount of serum still left in my last bottle and the consistency is still thicker as usual.
Packaging has also changed.
Don't know whether the company has upgraded it's product or the company/manufacturer had downgraded the product.
Given 3 stars as am sceptical and may further update once results are there

Foxtale 15% Vitamin C Face Serum for Glowing Skin | Pure L-Ascorbic Acid and Vitamin E | Brightening Serum for Dark Spots,Dull Skin,Uneven Skin Tone | All Skin Types | 30 ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,Safe to say, I loved this serum. I've used the serum for 6 months, and this is my honest review.

Firstly, WHAT THE HELL! I LOVED IT SO MUCH!!! The immediate smoothness of my skin was baffling. This Vitamin C serum was nothing like any other Vitamin C serum I've tried in the past. I loved the consistency, the refreshed feeling and the glow I felt upon immediately applying it. Over 2-3 months, I could see my skin glow and got compliments from people for my reduced facial scarring.

On the flip side, I could see that the serum has now oxidized. Which happens with Vitamin C serums I guess, but I am assuming that this particular serum oxidizes faster. Which is fine, the ingredients are super effective and the 15% Vitamin C composition is very gentle on the skin despite being a high concentration. I guess the formula could be more stable? But apart from that, faced no other issues. Absolutely loved it! 8/10 a good serum for beginners! Just ensure that you use it regularly and finish it within 4-5 months, and you'll be gtg.

Foxtale 15% Vitamin C Face Serum for Glowing Skin | Pure L-Ascorbic Acid and Vitamin E | Brightening Serum for Dark Spots,Dull Skin,Uneven Skin Tone | All Skin Types | 30 ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,Safe to say, I loved this serum. I've used the serum for 6 months, and this is my honest review.

Firstly, WHAT THE HELL! I LOVED IT SO MUCH!!! The immediate smoothness of my skin was baffling. This Vitamin C serum was nothing like any other Vitamin C serum I've tried in the past. I loved the consistency, the refreshed feeling and the glow I felt upon immediately applying it. Over 2-3 months, I could see my skin glow and got compliments from people for my reduced facial scarring.

On the flip side, I could see that the serum has now oxidized. Which happens with Vitamin C serums I guess, but I am assuming that this particular serum oxidizes faster. Which is fine, the ingredients are super effective and the 15% Vitamin C composition is very gentle on the skin despite being a high concentration. I guess the formula could be more stable? But apart from that, faced no other issues. Absolutely loved it! 8/10 a good serum for beginners! Just ensure that you use it regularly and finish it within 4-5 months, and you'll be gtg.

It had a foul smell and the serum colour was orange with oil mixed with it. No words to explain the condition I got it in.

The Man Company 40% Vitamin C Face Serum With Hyaluronic Acid | Boosts Collagen | Glowing & Brightening Skin | Soft, Smooth & Supple | All Skin Types - 30ml,1.0 out of 5 stars,Overall a very nice serum to use. The texture easily absorbs into the skin and has a slight fragrance however I think its mainly from the serval botanical extracts. One of the primary ingredients in this serum is niacinamides (Vitamin B3) and this does help with things like rosacea, pigmentation issues, age lines. The vitamin C in the product sat at 15th position which I felt was strange for what claims to be a 40% vitamin C (Sodium ascorbyl phosphate for anyone curious of the vitamin c source) after a week of using I've not really noticed a difference going form a 23% vitamin C in which the active ascorbic acid (vitamin c) sits as the second ingredients. This serum making me question the strength of the serum I don't believe its at 40% as the product simply doesn't feel strong enough (Vitamin C in high dosage tingles on the skin) and after using twice a day for a week I'm pretty confident this is a niacinamide serum (the primary active ingredient) with some Vitamin C. A nice serum however mislabelled and being miss sold.

I am not going to be a repeat customer.

While the Axis Y spot correcting glowing serum promises luminous skin and dark spot correction, it falls short of delivering instant results. Despite consistent use, the glow and spot correction were not as noticeable as expected. It requires patience and prolonged use to see significant improvements. Additionally, its high price may deter some potential buyers. However, the serum's lightweight texture and pleasant scent make it a decent addition to a skincare routine for those willing to wait for results.

AXIS-Y Dark Spot Correcting Glow Serum 50ml / 1.69 fl. oz | Brightening Serum | Korean Skincare, Dark Spot Treatment, Hyperpigmentation Treatment,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ya no pensaba comprarlo (este es mi segundo tubo) porque no ve√≠a cambio alguno, pero en las √∫ltimas dos semanas de uso del primer tubo de repente las manchas tuvieron un cambio radical en un par de d√≠as, fue muy notorio. La piel del rostro se ve m√°s uniforme y las rojeces y manchas de sol disminuyeron mucho. Por eso lo volv√≠ a comprar. Aguas porque venden muchos fake, este si es original.

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence (100 ml),5.0 out of 5 stars,This product does a great job if hydrating the skin. It seals in all the moisture to make the skin soft and supple. It has no fragrance which I like as I primarily use this at night. Also used this snail mucin to heal a sunburn

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence (100 ml),5.0 out of 5 stars,Guys my skin was an absolute mess, i used to get heavy breakouts and would be scared to use products that‚Äôll break me out more. I finally found the balance and what worked for my skin including the products I used until one day they stopped working for me:/ I‚Äôve been sticking to my same routine but eliminating the things I thought broke me out however that included my moisturizer and serum too which left my skin flaky and dull. I‚Äôve been hearing people rave about this online for soo long I finally decided to give it a try after reading the reviews and let me tell you they did not lie. My skin went from breaking out all over neck included to calm and smooth and glowing within 2 days (noticed a huge difference overnight on first use) it leaves my skin hydrated and bouncy, is healing my skin barrier, doesn‚Äôt leave me sticky or breaks me out. It does have a slight sticky texture to the face when it‚Äôs near dry but it doesn‚Äôt bother me and it truly isn‚Äôt a sticky feeling like honey. Doesn‚Äôt have a scent to it which is also good bc sometimes fragrant products irritate my skin. As for the product ordered from the seller, it seems to be the legit one and works great from my experience. Definitely will be buying again

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence (100 ml),5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using this Snail Essence for around four months now, mainly based on my sister's recommendation, who's a follower of K-beauty trends. I have to admit that it makes the skin feel soft and well-moisturized. Also, it is unscented.

Although there are claims of other benefits associated with snail essence, I must admit that I have only noticed its moisturizing effects. However, there were no harmful effects either, which is always a relief when trying new skincare products.

Although I will prefer to use a Vitamin C serum in my skincare routine, I must admit that this Snail Essence does an excellent job of hydrating the skin.

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence (100 ml),5.0 out of 5 stars,Really good product and my skin loves this. Getting more for my mom to use on her lower legs (thin skin).

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence (100 ml),4.0 out of 5 stars,It hasn't broke me out yet I don't think. I get fungal acne or whatever you call it and it hasn't gotten worse since I started using this product. It's not overly moisturizing but most moisturisers clog my pores bad. Put it on when face is damp still to keep moisture in the skin. This is unrelated... but manuka honey had been helping my skin significantly. I usually leave a mask of it on for like as long as I can once a day. Good luck peeps!

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence (100 ml),5.0 out of 5 stars,Snail goop ..what to say about this potion ü§î
I like the packaging. Clean looking containers.
Easy to use, convenient pump.
Scent is ok.
Feels a lil weird applying this to my face knowing someone tickle a snail until it gave his contribution to our purposeüòê
So there‚Äôs that üôÑ
I use this along another moisturizer to load my face at night and keep me from dehydrating and looking like mummy in the morning, I have dry skin issues üòÖ
I think my skin like this concoction, skin feels supple and considering coming back from the dead üôÉ
No side effects yet(it‚Äôs been few weeks) and haven‚Äôt grown antennas yet so
I think I will continue with this goop.

So if you are looking for a new way to spend your money..go for it.

Cos-IQ 20% Niacinamide Face Serum For Clear Glowing Skin, Bright Skin, Reduces Dullness, Hydrates & Repairs Skin with Vit B3 & Hyaluronic Acid for Targets Acne Marks | For Women & Men | 30ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Cosiq Niacinamide Face Serum for a few weeks now, and I am absolutely impressed with the results. This serum has noticeably brightened my skin, giving me a healthy, radiant glow that I‚Äôve been struggling to achieve with other products. It's lightweight and absorbs quickly without any greasy residue, making it perfect to layer under my moisturizer and sunscreen. I also love how it hydrates my skin, leaving it soft and smooth throughout the day.

Since I started using it, I‚Äôve seen a significant reduction in the appearance of my pores and a visible improvement in my overall skin texture. It has also helped calm my occasional redness and kept breakouts at bay, making my skin look clearer and more even-toned. Best of all, it‚Äôs gentle enough for my sensitive skin and hasn‚Äôt caused any irritation, which is a big plus. Overall, this serum delivers excellent results at a great price, and it has definitely become a staple in my skincare routine!

Cos-IQ 20% Niacinamide Face Serum For Clear Glowing Skin, Bright Skin, Reduces Dullness, Hydrates & Repairs Skin with Vit B3 & Hyaluronic Acid for Targets Acne Marks | For Women & Men | 30ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,I‚Äôve been using cosIQ‚Äôs Vitamin B-3 - 5% Niacinamide Serum, and I am genuinely impressed with the results. This serum is a perfect blend of 5% niacinamide 2% peptides, and1% hyaluronic acid, making it a powerhouse for healthy, radiant skin.The niacinamide works wonders for minimizing my pores and reducing redness, leaving my skin visibly smoother and more even-toned. The added peptides give my skin a firm, youthful look, while the hyaluronic acid keeps it deeply hydrated without feeling greasy or heavy.
What I love most is how quickly my skin absorbed the serum and how lightweight it feels. It‚Äôs become a must-have in my skincare routine.
Highly recommend for anyone looking to improve skin texture, hydration, and overall glow!

Deconstruct Brightening Serum: 10% Niacinamide Face Serum For Pigmentation & Dark Spots | 0.3% Alpha Arbutin | For Women & Men | Reduces Dark Spots & Acne Marks | Fragrance Free |30Ml,1.0 out of 5 stars,I am writing to share my negative experience with the serum I recently purchased. Unfortunately, instead of improving my skin, the serum seemed to exacerbate my condition. Each time I used the product, I developed painful white pimples. Initially, I thought the serum might be bringing hidden acne to the surface, so I continued using it for about a month. However, the breakouts did not subside; in fact, they persisted.

Realizing that the serum might be the cause, I decided to stop using it. Once I did, the white pimples gradually disappeared, and my skin began to improve. I resumed my skincare routine without the serum, and my skin has since returned to its normal state, free of those painful pimples.

This product not only failed to deliver on its promises but also made my skin significantly worse. I strongly advise against purchasing this serum, as it may cause more harm than good.

This product not only failed to deliver on its promises but also made my skin significantly worse. I strongly advise against purchasing this serum, as it may cause more harm than good.

Minimalist Multi Peptide Night Face Serum for Ageless Younger Skin, 30 ml | Collagen Boosting, Hydrating & Overnight Repair Serum for Women & Men with 7% Matrixyl 3000 & 3% Bio-Placenta,3.0 out of 5 stars,I waited for 1 month to give a genuine review. I used it daily and here is the result. The serum quickly gets absorbed in the skin. It is non-sticky. It makes your skin smooth and adds shine to it when you apply. I haven't seen any other changes on my skin apart from this. I don't have wrinkles so can't say if it works on it. I will have to wait for sometime to comment whether it removes fine lines or not. Overall, it is a good serum to make you skin soft and supple.

Lacto Calamine 10% Niacinamide Face Serum | 30ml | Pore Minimizing, Acne Marks, Blemishes & Oil Balancing | Face Serum for Women & Men | Reduces Pigmentation | Dermatologically Tested & Fragrance Free,3.0 out of 5 stars,For oily skin like mine, it takes time to absorb and in humid climate it creates stickiness on face. You would like to wash it off as soon as possible. Seems it can be used in night for oily skin. Maybe suitable for dry skin type. Doesn't do much on dark spots. These things have to used continuously to see results. Company says it's best for oily skin, then I don't understand why they make sticky products for oily skin. Seems they don't test it on their skin and leave to consumers to test them.

Lacto Calamine 10% Niacinamide Face Serum | 30ml | Pore Minimizing, Acne Marks, Blemishes & Oil Balancing | Face Serum for Women & Men | Reduces Pigmentation | Dermatologically Tested & Fragrance Free,3.0 out of 5 stars,For oily skin like mine, it takes time to absorb and in humid climate it creates stickiness on face. You would like to wash it off as soon as possible. Seems it can be used in night for oily skin. Maybe suitable for dry skin type. Doesn't do much on dark spots. These things have to used continuously to see results. Company says it's best for oily skin, then I don't understand why they make sticky products for oily skin. Seems they don't test it on their skin and leave to consumers to test them.

Minimalist Retinol 0.6% Mid-Strength Anti Aging Face Serum For Unisex, Reduces Fine Lines & Wrinkles, Medium Strength Retinol Formula (Pack Of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,I don't have much experience using retinol. Before using this product I've only used one other retinol serum. I decided to buy this one because it's a little bit stronger than the one I was using. I like to use retinol to help my acne, so over the next few weeks I will give an update on how my acne is doing. The consistency of the product is like a very thin oil, which makes sense because of its ingredients. I do think that it's easy to massage into the skin. The dropper is a bit annoying because I find that the product wants to drip out even when I'm not squeezing to get any product out.

Garnier Skin Naturals Bright Complete Vitamin C Serum UV Cream, Vitamin C Day Cream for Sun Protection and Skin Brightening - Suitable For all Skin Types, 45g,3.0 out of 5 stars,I was disappointed with the Garnier Serum Cream as it has a surprisingly dry texture, similar to Fair & Lovely cream. If you have dry skin, I would not recommend using this product on its own as it may exacerbate dryness. However, you may be able to use it if you layer it with a moisturizer to help lock in hydration. Unfortunately, this serum cream was not suitable for my dry skin, and I would caution others with similar skin types to exercise caution.

Cetaphil Moisturising Cream for Face & Body , Dry to Normal skin, 80 gm,4.0 out of 5 stars,Deducting one star for damaged on arrival, but the product is 10 on 10. Using the cream for sometime and it really helpful in blemishing dark and fine spots over skin. Keeps your skin well hydrated, soft and healthy. Cetaphil always wins. Cover it up with a good sunscreen for better results. Great choice so far.

Cetaphil Moisturising Cream for Face & Body , Dry to Normal skin, 80 gm,5.0 out of 5 stars,This cream made for sensitive and very dry skin. If you have then you must try it. It will give you best skin texture and make you feel comfortable from sensitively. But for summer it's too sticky and make skin sweaty.

Dot & Key Ceramides Moisturizer with Hyaluronic for Intense Moisturizing and Skin Strengthening | With Probiotic & Rice Water I Barrier Repair Cream | For Dry Skin, Normal Skin & Sensitive Skin | 100g,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Dot & Key Ceramides Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid for a few weeks now, and I‚Äôm really impressed with the results. The moisturizer has a lightweight, creamy texture that absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue. It provides intense hydration, and I've noticed my skin feels more plump and resilient. The subtle scent is pleasant, and the packaging is convenient. My skin is combination and this product works well without causing breakouts. My only minor issue is that I wish it came in a larger size. Overall, I highly recommend this moisturizer for its effective hydration and skin-strengthening benefits."

Minimalist 10% Niacinamide Face Serum for Acne Marks, Blemishes & Oil Balancing with Zinc | Skin Clarifying Anti Acne Serum for Oily & Acne Prone Skin (30 ml (Pack of 1)),5.0 out of 5 stars,This serum, and Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin serum are my new favorites. I bought both to combat sun damage on my face, since my face was super tan in comparison to my neck. At first, I didn't feel like I saw much of a difference, but after really staring at my face today, I think it actually helped lift my face a couple shades! The tan hasn't completely gone, but my face is definitely lighter. However, that's not the reason I love these 2 serums so much. Using them in combination with prescription tretinoin has made my skin SO SMOOTH!! The tretinoin alone helped some stuff, but using it with this made my skin glowy and smooth. I am in my early 20s, and I started noticing the formation of early wrinkles. Not quite deep set yet, so they were still treatable. They bugged me a lot, but once I started using this stuff, my wrinkles went away! I was shocked! Not to mention a lot of the dull texture in my skin is gone. Now my skin looks so plump and soft.

I also really love the packaging. The bottle comes in a box, that's in another box, so it's well protected. The bottle is also made of UV blocking glass, and the label has anything and everything you need to know about the product, including the pH, and what to combine with it. Plus, I love how affordable it is. I'm definitely gonna be buying more of this in the future, and I highly recommend it üòç

Minimalist 10% Niacinamide Face Serum for Acne Marks, Blemishes & Oil Balancing with Zinc | Skin Clarifying Anti Acne Serum for Oily & Acne Prone Skin (30 ml (Pack of 1)),5.0 out of 5 stars,Since it's a highly concentrated serum start by using it 2-3 times a week for a week. Then slowly start using it everyday.
After litteraly the 2nd use, my acne scars are starting to fade and my skin looks way more smoother than before. Love this product.

Minimalist 10% Niacinamide Face Serum for Acne Marks, Blemishes & Oil Balancing with Zinc | Skin Clarifying Anti Acne Serum for Oily & Acne Prone Skin (30 ml (Pack of 1)),3.0 out of 5 stars,Good product but not for acne . May help to reduce dullness and spots but not acne . Try different serum from minimalist for different concerns , this serum is maybe the overall all purpose serum but give slow results.

Minimalist 10% Niacinamide Face Serum for Acne Marks, Blemishes & Oil Balancing with Zinc | Skin Clarifying Anti Acne Serum for Oily & Acne Prone Skin (30 ml (Pack of 1)),5.0 out of 5 stars,I used it a year ago and it made my skin super smooth and beautiful. All the marks were gone! I tried another brand at a cheaper cost and the purging was just too much and skin didn‚Äôt improve much.
Use it in the morning and at night for about a few weeks to see the change.
Follow up with salycilic acid to maintain the results.

Minimalist 10% Niacinamide Face Serum for Acne Marks, Blemishes & Oil Balancing with Zinc | Skin Clarifying Anti Acne Serum for Oily & Acne Prone Skin (30 ml (Pack of 1)),5.0 out of 5 stars,This serum, and Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin serum are my new favorites. I bought both to combat sun damage on my face, since my face was super tan in comparison to my neck. At first, I didn't feel like I saw much of a difference, but after really staring at my face today, I think it actually helped lift my face a couple shades! The tan hasn't completely gone, but my face is definitely lighter. However, that's not the reason I love these 2 serums so much. Using them in combination with prescription tretinoin has made my skin SO SMOOTH!! The tretinoin alone helped some stuff, but using it with this made my skin glowy and smooth. I am in my early 20s, and I started noticing the formation of early wrinkles. Not quite deep set yet, so they were still treatable. They bugged me a lot, but once I started using this stuff, my wrinkles went away! I was shocked! Not to mention a lot of the dull texture in my skin is gone. Now my skin looks so plump and soft.

I also really love the packaging. The bottle comes in a box, that's in another box, so it's well protected. The bottle is also made of UV blocking glass, and the label has anything and everything you need to know about the product, including the pH, and what to combine with it. Plus, I love how affordable it is. I'm definitely gonna be buying more of this in the future, and I highly recommend it üòç

Also it's too expensive for the quantity provided. Used it only twice with their vitamin C serum and skin feels oily even after washing it off with water and wiping with face towel. All minimalist products are very sticky on the skin. Also it's mentioned as non comodogenic which it doesn't seem to be actually. All other positive reviews seem to be a marketing gimmick...

Raaga Professional De-Tan Pack with Kojic, Lactic Acid & Arbutin | Tan Removal Cream | Dermatologically Tested, Peroxide, Hydroquinone & Sulphate Free- 12g x 6 (72gm),3.0 out of 5 stars,It's a good product, white creamy paste. After you apply, it gives itching sensation but after few minutes you can feel cooling sensation. Please don't keep it on face for longer time. Use for 10-15 mins safety point of view. It works as claimed. Smell is mild.

COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence 3.38 fl.oz 100ml, Hydrating Serum for Face with Snail Secretion Filtrate for Dull Skin & Fine Lines, Korean Skincare,5.0 out of 5 stars,Was skeptical about the authenticity of the product but I can confirm that I have received the original product. Worth all the hype, provides intense hydration like no other moisturizer can give. I could describe it as one reason for my glass skin!
Although I have combination skin, I think this will work the best for dry skin and acne prone skin. However, give it a try as each skin is different and it may not suit everyone.

COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence 3.38 fl.oz 100ml, Hydrating Serum for Face with Snail Secretion Filtrate for Dull Skin & Fine Lines, Korean Skincare,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the past several years I have had moderate redness on my cheeks and chin, even with using gentle cleansers and moisturizing. My mom has rosacea so it's possible that's in my genes. I always had to cover up this redness with concealer but it bummed me out that I didn't feel confident without makeup on. Fast forward to buying this product and using it for about a month-- my inflammation/red patches are basically gone and my skin tone is so much more even! Another huge plus: because this product has drastically reduced the inflammation, it has also reduced the appearance of the red pigmentation from my acne scars. They look WAY less pronounced now and I'm amazed! Using this product has really increased my confidence when leaving the house without makeup. My skin looks healthier and is more moisturized. It is also an excellent addition to my morning gua sha routine because of its slippery texture. I use the product twice a day on my face and neck and am SO happy it has made such a difference in my skin... Buy it!!

My skin looks brighter and more radiant. The lightweight, non-greasy formula absorbs quickly without any residue. It has significantly improved my skin texture and reduced dark spots. I appreciate that it's fragrance-free and gentle on my sensitive skin. The Vitamin C has given my complexion a healthy glow, making my skin look more even-toned and refreshed. This serum has become an essential part of my skincare routine. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to enhance their skin's appearance.

One piece of advice is not to go into sunlight immediately after applying it, apply sunscreen or some UV++ protection.

Minimalist 10% Vitamin C Face Serum for Glowing Skin (Formulated & Tested For Sensitive Skin) | Non Irritating | Non Sticky | Brightening Vit C Formula For Men and Women | 30 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,I just had to share my experience with the Minimalist Vitamin C serum. It's seriously been a game-changer for my skin! I used to struggle with uneven skin texture and dark spots, but since I started using this serum, my skin has transformed. It's become so much smoother and clearer, and those pesky dark spots have faded away. My skin now has this amazing shiny and radiant look that I absolutely love. The best part? I've actually stopped wearing as much makeup since I started using this serum. It's that good! It's not sticky at all, which is a big plus for me. The serum absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving any residue or tackiness. It's lightweight and comfortable to wear, making it perfect for both morning and evening use. The performance is top-notch too. The packaging has a tight seal to keep the product fresh, and the consistency is just right, not too thick or runny. Overall, it's a fantastic product that I highly recommend trying out! üòäüåü
,Just Herbs Lip and Cheek Tint for the third time, and let me tell you, I'm absolutely loving it! The shade 06pink forever is just perfect, and what's even better is that it's super easy to carry around. Now, let's talk about the texture. It's so smooth and lightweight, making it a breeze to apply on both my lips and cheeks. The color payoff is fantastic too. It gives a natural flush to my cheeks and a subtle tint to my lips, which is exactly what I was looking for. One thing I really appreciate about this product is the packaging. It's compact and travel-friendly, making it convenient to take with me wherever I go. I've also noticed that it feels moisturizing on my lips, which is a huge bonus. If I had to mention any downsides, it Tint doesn't have the longest staying power, so I find myself reapplying it. But the great thing about it being made with natural ingredients is that you can feel good about putting it on your skin more often.So, even though it may not last as long as we'd hope, at least we can enjoy its natural goodness without any worries. Overall, I highly recommend the Just Herbs Lip and Cheek Tint in the shade 06pink forever.

The serum itself is quite runny. It brightens my skin and makes it firmer. I have rosacea (it doesn‚Äôt trigger it) and my skin is prone to hyperpigmentation hence why I was recommended vit C serum. I only use it in the morning because I‚Äôm not sure how to combine it in the evening with my active ingredient cream. I will be definitely looking at other products from the minimalist.

**Visible Results:**
Since incorporating this serum into my routine, I've noticed a significant improvement in my skin's overall glow and texture. My complexion looks more radiant, and the appearance of dark spots has visibly reduced. It's truly a confidence booster!

Garnier Skin Naturals, Bright Complete 30X Vitamin C Booster Face Serum, Increases Skin's Glow Instantly and Reduces Spots Overtime, with 2% Niacinamide + 0.5% Salicylic Acid, for Men & Women, 30 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,If you're looking for a serum that can help make your skin brighter and more even, Garnier's Vitamin C Serum might be just what you need! Many people who have used it say it works well to fade dark spots and give skin a nice glow.
It has an ingredient called salicylic acid that helps get rid of dead skin cells. This can make your skin feel smoother. Just keep in mind, when you first start using it, your skin might feel a bit oily. That's normal and happens because the serum is cleaning out your pores.
Some people noticed their skin got better after about a month of using the serum regularly. But don't worry if it takes a bit longer for you. Everyone's skin is different! It's important to be patient and give the serum time to work its magic.
The serum feels light on your skin and doesn't make it feel sticky, which is great. It can also help make your skin feel soft and supple.
One thing to know is that the way you put the serum on your skin could be better. But for the price, many people think it's a good product to try if you want to make your skin look brighter and more even.
Just remember, if you have dry skin, it might help to only wash your face once a day and use a toner before putting on the serum. And if your skin feels irritated at first, try using the serum every other day instead of every day.
Overall, Garnier's Vitamin C Serum seems to be a helpful product for getting brighter, more even-looking skin. With a little time and patience, it might be just what you need for a glowing complexion!

Garnier Skin Naturals, Bright Complete 30X Vitamin C Booster Face Serum, Increases Skin's Glow Instantly and Reduces Spots Overtime, with 2% Niacinamide + 0.5% Salicylic Acid, for Men & Women, 30 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,If you're looking for a serum that can help make your skin brighter and more even, Garnier's Vitamin C Serum might be just what you need! Many people who have used it say it works well to fade dark spots and give skin a nice glow.
It has an ingredient called salicylic acid that helps get rid of dead skin cells. This can make your skin feel smoother. Just keep in mind, when you first start using it, your skin might feel a bit oily. That's normal and happens because the serum is cleaning out your pores.
Some people noticed their skin got better after about a month of using the serum regularly. But don't worry if it takes a bit longer for you. Everyone's skin is different! It's important to be patient and give the serum time to work its magic.
The serum feels light on your skin and doesn't make it feel sticky, which is great. It can also help make your skin feel soft and supple.
One thing to know is that the way you put the serum on your skin could be better. But for the price, many people think it's a good product to try if you want to make your skin look brighter and more even.
Just remember, if you have dry skin, it might help to only wash your face once a day and use a toner before putting on the serum. And if your skin feels irritated at first, try using the serum every other day instead of every day.
Overall, Garnier's Vitamin C Serum seems to be a helpful product for getting brighter, more even-looking skin. With a little time and patience, it might be just what you need for a glowing complexion!

Not the best applicator. Results could take a while, been 11 days since using this and no pronounced skin upgrade but does make the skin supple, doesn't irritate it, non-sticky and generally evens-out the skin.
Brightness- not so sure about this.

Pond's Super Light Gel Oil Free Moisturiser With Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E || 200 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very affordable and high quality product! It feels like a version of neutrogena water gel. Works for acne prone skin. Extremely moisturizing, smells refreshing, well packed and effective!

Pond's Super Light Gel Oil Free Moisturiser With Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E || 200 ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,The cream has a wonderful gel like texture, and gives a very cooling sensation when applied on the skin. It is perfect for super oily skinned people who want something very lightweight, it is not thick and greasy like other moisturizers, making it perfect for Indian summers. It's ingredients look promising and the cream is non sticky, however, it is heavily fragranced.
Overall, I would recommend it if you're not allergic/ sensitive to fragrance, especially when it goes on sale, and the validity of the product is cleared since it comes beautifully sealed.

So this tiny little jar is jam packed with this cool lightweight gel that isn't sticky at all! It has a light refreshing scent that is cool & soothing
I highly recommend this SUPER LIGHT GEL from Ponds. Although it's very small-- a tiny dab goes a long soothing way!!

Pond's Super Light Gel Oil Free Moisturiser With Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E || 200 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am super picky when it comes to my facial creams due to my skin being very oily in the summer and prone to breakouts, so I can‚Äôt use actual creams and have to use water based moisturizers.

Pros:
Very light water gel. Absorbs quickly and is perfect for my skin, keeps it moisturized all day long. No sticky feel is the best part! Has a very light fresh fragrance. I think I like it better than Neutrogena‚Äôs water cream which has been my favorite until now.

Cons:
Small size, more like eye creams size. Was expecting something bigger based on the price.

Even though it‚Äôs a small size, I wold probably buy again.

Since I live abroad, its hard to get this elsewhere, so I make sure to bulk order every year. And this year in 2024, my haul is equally abundant.

Dr. Sheth's Ceramide & Vitamin C Oil - Free Moisturizer| Lightweight Moisturizer to Hydrate & Brighten Skin | With Vitamin C, Ceramide & Ashwagandha | For Women & Men | 50g,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm such a Dr. Sheth fan, I think you can guess that from the image. I got 2 of all the moisturisers ever available at Dr. Sheth's. I was introduced to this last year by a yt influencer and bought like 6 moisturisers and sunscreens last year. Since I live abroad, its hard to get this elsewhere, so I make sure to bulk order every year. And this year in 2024, my haul is equally abundant.

Neutriderm Moisturising Lotion w/Vitamin E - 125 mL,5.0 out of 5 stars,As someone who's deeply invested in skincare due to my outdoor activities and profession, finding the right moisturizing lotion is crucial for maintaining healthy and radiant skin. Recently, I had the opportunity to try out the Neutriderm Moisturising Lotion, and I must say, it left a lasting impression.

Texture and Application:
One of the standout features of this lotion is its lightweight and non-greasy texture. It effortlessly glides onto the skin, absorbing quickly without leaving behind any residue. This makes it ideal for daily use, as it doesn't interfere with makeup application or feel heavy on the skin.

Hydration Power:
I was particularly impressed by how well the Neutriderm Moisturising Lotion provides hydration. Living an active lifestyle often exposes my skin to various environmental stressors, and this lotion truly helps in replenishing moisture. It leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth, and adequately hydrated throughout the day.

Scent and Sensation:
The lotion boasts a subtle and pleasant scent that adds a touch of luxury to my skincare routine. It's not overpowering and doesn't clash with any other fragrances I might wear. Additionally, upon application, there's a refreshing sensation that's both invigorating and soothing.

Neutriderm Moisturising Lotion w/Vitamin E - 125 mL,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best moisturizer I have come across till now. I was searching for a moisturizer which will help me repair my skin barrier. I have used few creams before this one. No matter how many creams/moisturizer i apply it didn't used to feel smooth. On the first application my skin fell in love with this moisturizer, the formulation is so smooth and pretty. Excellent, stop almost all the redness, dark spots or pigmentation of my face in a few days. Makes skin soft and moisturized/hydrated. There are many creams which look fancy and expensive but they aren't actually helping your skin, this cream has actual ingredients to help your skin.
Overall item is very good, it came original. The product smell is gentle and I feel well hydrated after applying that. Worthy product‚ú®

The Derma Co 10% Vitamin C Face Serum I With Vitamin C, 5% Niacinamide & Hyaluronic Acid I For Skin Radiance I Day + Night Regimen | Suitable For All Skin Types- 30ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Derma Co 10% Vitamin C Face Serum with Vitamin C, 5% Niacinamide & Hyaluronic Acid has truly transformed my skincare routine, delivering exceptional results that speak volumes about its efficacy and quality. As someone who's always on the lookout for skincare products that deliver visible results, I can confidently say that this serum lives up to its promises.

First and foremost, let's talk about the ingredients. With a potent blend of 10% Vitamin C, 5% Niacinamide, and Hyaluronic Acid, this serum is a powerhouse of skin-loving nutrients. Vitamin C is renowned for its brightening properties, helping to fade dark spots, even out skin tone, and impart a radiant glow. Niacinamide complements Vitamin C by reducing inflammation, minimizing pores, and enhancing skin texture, while Hyaluronic Acid provides intense hydration, leaving the skin plump and supple.

The texture of the serum is lightweight and absorbs effortlessly into the skin, leaving behind no greasy residue. I appreciate that it is suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin, as it is free from harsh chemicals, parabens, and sulfates. It's also cruelty-free, which aligns with my values as a conscious consumer.

After incorporating this serum into my daily skincare routine, I noticed a remarkable improvement in the overall appearance and texture of my skin. My complexion appeared brighter, more even-toned, and youthful. Stubborn dark spots and acne scars began to fade, and my skin felt noticeably smoother and more hydrated.

Another aspect I love about The Derma Co Vitamin C Face Serum is its versatility. Whether used alone as a targeted treatment or layered with other skincare products, it seamlessly integrates into my routine, allowing me to customize my skincare regimen according to my skin's needs.

In terms of value for money, the quality and effectiveness of this serum far exceed its price point. The 30ml bottle may seem small, but a little goes a long way, and the results are undeniably worth it.

Overall, I highly recommend The Derma Co 10% Vitamin C Face Serum to anyone looking to rejuvenate their skin and achieve a radiant complexion. With its powerful blend of ingredients and proven results, it has become a staple in my skincare arsenal, and I can't imagine my routine without it.

The Derma Co 10% Vitamin C Face Serum I With Vitamin C, 5% Niacinamide & Hyaluronic Acid I For Skin Radiance I Day + Night Regimen | Suitable For All Skin Types- 30ml,1.0 out of 5 stars,Tried it out one night, my face started itching and feeling irritated so I skipped one night and applied it the next time. Same issue, itching and irritation, so I cut the dosage in half. Tried it again the night after the next night, same issue, had to wash it off. Made my skin break out a lot the next morning. Maybe I have a sensitivity to Vitamin C, all I know is that if your skin is prone to dryness or is sensitive, use with caution or don‚Äôt use at all.

The Derma Co 10% Vitamin C Face Serum I With Vitamin C, 5% Niacinamide & Hyaluronic Acid I For Skin Radiance I Day + Night Regimen | Suitable For All Skin Types- 30ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Derma Co 10% Vitamin C Face Serum with Vitamin C, 5% Niacinamide & Hyaluronic Acid has truly transformed my skincare routine, delivering exceptional results that speak volumes about its efficacy and quality. As someone who's always on the lookout for skincare products that deliver visible results, I can confidently say that this serum lives up to its promises.

First and foremost, let's talk about the ingredients. With a potent blend of 10% Vitamin C, 5% Niacinamide, and Hyaluronic Acid, this serum is a powerhouse of skin-loving nutrients. Vitamin C is renowned for its brightening properties, helping to fade dark spots, even out skin tone, and impart a radiant glow. Niacinamide complements Vitamin C by reducing inflammation, minimizing pores, and enhancing skin texture, while Hyaluronic Acid provides intense hydration, leaving the skin plump and supple.

The texture of the serum is lightweight and absorbs effortlessly into the skin, leaving behind no greasy residue. I appreciate that it is suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin, as it is free from harsh chemicals, parabens, and sulfates. It's also cruelty-free, which aligns with my values as a conscious consumer.

After incorporating this serum into my daily skincare routine, I noticed a remarkable improvement in the overall appearance and texture of my skin. My complexion appeared brighter, more even-toned, and youthful. Stubborn dark spots and acne scars began to fade, and my skin felt noticeably smoother and more hydrated.

Another aspect I love about The Derma Co Vitamin C Face Serum is its versatility. Whether used alone as a targeted treatment or layered with other skincare products, it seamlessly integrates into my routine, allowing me to customize my skincare regimen according to my skin's needs.

In terms of value for money, the quality and effectiveness of this serum far exceed its price point. The 30ml bottle may seem small, but a little goes a long way, and the results are undeniably worth it.

Overall, I highly recommend The Derma Co 10% Vitamin C Face Serum to anyone looking to rejuvenate their skin and achieve a radiant complexion. With its powerful blend of ingredients and proven results, it has become a staple in my skincare arsenal, and I can't imagine my routine without it.

UrbanBotanics¬Æ Pure Aloe Vera Skin/Hair Gel With Vitamin E & Natural Emollients (Paraben Free), 200g,5.0 out of 5 stars,ABOUT THE PRODUCT - This Aloe vera gel is Transparent in colour, no fragrance at all and thick in texture with may be / may be not with little granules in it - AT TIMES could be because it is natural. It is my 2nd bottle and I hugely recommend it as it has definately had great effects on my super sensitive skin. It is non-greasy, very light on skin when applied, absorbency is great. Blends well into to skin leaving skin non-sticky, supple and soft. Texture is thick - gel like but when applied it spreads easily and very little goes a long long way. So worth investing into.

The Gel consists of ingredients like Tea, Aloe vera Juice, Glycerin and Citric acid. Also the most important of all is it is MADE IN INDIA and it is free from Chemicals and I truly feel it's genuinely 100% Chemical free and Cruelty Free as well. No allergies, No side effects, no skin rashes (red patches) - just wonderful looking, glowing, radiating clear skin. If single person is using gel lasts almost 6 months for sure.

**PS - Get inner elbow patch test done - though there won't be any side effects and no smaller bottle is available. Also please give your skin and product time for it to show results - if you are 30Years and under results might be faster. But post 30 will take time to show results.

I have also applied this gel on my scalp - definately my to-go after a stressful day, definately calms the nerves down and also on hair - to get naturally beautiful moisturized hair.

APPLICATION (AS PER THE COMPANY) - Apply directly on skin and AIR DRY it for best results.

PACKAGING - Comes in a plastic bottle/jar with a silver colour lid.

AVAILABILITY - Was available both the times when ordered.

PRICE - INR 299/- for 200 GM's totally worth the price. It goes a long long way (6 months) if applied only on face and neck area - ONCE a day and single person use.

SELLER - Sold by "PRIME H".

DELIVERY - On time, as expected.

**Please note Aloe very gel has had many advantages over the years. So I consider this to be a multi use gel which can be used as a base before applying make up, to healing wounds, on scalp, on Face, on burns, as Hair gel and many many more uses.

Happy Purchasing !!!

UrbanBotanics¬Æ Pure Aloe Vera Skin/Hair Gel With Vitamin E & Natural Emollients (Paraben Free), 200g,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product ,it's actually light with no fragrance at all..
It's better than any other popular brands.
,Puneet Sahgal
UrbanBotanics¬Æ Pure Aloe Vera Skin/Hair Gel With Vitamin E & Natural Emollients (Paraben Free), 200g,5.0 out of 5 stars,Organic and natural are my kind of products, that is what attracted me to this. This is the Best aloe vera gel From Urban Botanics. I‚Äôve bought that actually feels like I‚Äôm using it straight from the plant. I‚Äôm happy to use a product that has no nasty ingredients in it!

I love how simple the ingredients are on the bottle. No alcohol or fragrance added, just aloe Vera the way you want it. It is not watery which makes me trust in its purity ( not water diluted). we use it at home for a lot of things: sun burn, any skin irritation. It doesn't feel sticky when you apply and leaves skin feeling smooth. I have been using this particular gel for about a week, and it's been great. I even use it on my face - this is sort of the ultimate test for any skincare product, because I have stupidly sensitive facial skin. The gel leaves it soft and even sort of soothes it.
I give this five stars because it does everything it says it will - and it's actual aloe vera gel, not some clear gunk that's been dressed up with artificial colors and scents. This is just straight gel. I really love it.

What I like:
‚Ä¢ Goes on smooth
‚Ä¢ Very mild scent
‚Ä¢ Can be used by itself for skin and hair or used in a DIY lotion recipe
‚Ä¢ Not sticky or tacky
‚Ä¢ Amazing skin softener!
‚Ä¢ Great for burns and skin healing
‚Ä¢ 99 % organic Aloe

UrbanBotanics¬Æ Pure Aloe Vera Skin/Hair Gel With Vitamin E & Natural Emollients (Paraben Free), 200g,5.0 out of 5 stars,Organic and natural are my kind of products, that is what attracted me to this. This is the Best aloe vera gel From Urban Botanics. I‚Äôve bought that actually feels like I‚Äôm using it straight from the plant. I‚Äôm happy to use a product that has no nasty ingredients in it!

I love how simple the ingredients are on the bottle. No alcohol or fragrance added, just aloe Vera the way you want it. It is not watery which makes me trust in its purity ( not water diluted). we use it at home for a lot of things: sun burn, any skin irritation. It doesn't feel sticky when you apply and leaves skin feeling smooth. I have been using this particular gel for about a week, and it's been great. I even use it on my face - this is sort of the ultimate test for any skincare product, because I have stupidly sensitive facial skin. The gel leaves it soft and even sort of soothes it.
I give this five stars because it does everything it says it will - and it's actual aloe vera gel, not some clear gunk that's been dressed up with artificial colors and scents. This is just straight gel. I really love it.

What I like:
‚Ä¢ Goes on smooth
‚Ä¢ Very mild scent
‚Ä¢ Can be used by itself for skin and hair or used in a DIY lotion recipe
‚Ä¢ Not sticky or tacky
‚Ä¢ Amazing skin softener!
‚Ä¢ Great for burns and skin healing
‚Ä¢ 99 % organic Aloe

UrbanBotanics¬Æ Pure Aloe Vera Skin/Hair Gel With Vitamin E & Natural Emollients (Paraben Free), 200g,3.0 out of 5 stars,It is too small in this price, that too aloevera. Otherwise quality is good, could be little cheaper.

UrbanBotanics¬Æ Pure Aloe Vera Skin/Hair Gel With Vitamin E & Natural Emollients (Paraben Free), 200g,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a very good gel, transparent and free of any fragrance, it moisturises the skin very nicely, this natural product is better than the chemical one's available in the market. I am giving 4 stars as I feel this is over priced, The company should come up with a bigger pack to lower the cost, there are many brands available on Amazon itself at half the price, I'm happy with the performance.

UrbanBotanics¬Æ Pure Aloe Vera Skin/Hair Gel With Vitamin E & Natural Emollients (Paraben Free), 200g,5.0 out of 5 stars,My skin type is usually combination to oily; however, since I‚Äôm taking roaccutane, my face has been completely dry. I have tried everything from cleansing the day before, cleansing and moisturizing twice, and it still becomes very patchy whenever I put any makeup on (especially my under-eye area). I had yet to find a great ‚Äúprimer‚Äù or moisturizer for my face and this is the only product that actually makes my face look smooth and non-cakey. Definitely recommend!

Vaseline Deep Moisture Serum In Lotion, 400 ml | Enriched with Glycerin for Nourished Soft Skin,4.0 out of 5 stars,Vaseline Intensive Care Deep Moisture Nourishing Body Lotion is a fantastic daily moisturizer for both men and women. The 400ml bottle offers excellent value, and the non-sticky, fast-absorbing formula is perfect for dry, rough skin. Infused with glycerin, it provides deep and long-lasting hydration, leaving skin soft, smooth, and radiant. The mild scent is pleasant without being overpowering. While the large size is great for home use, a smaller, travel-friendly option would be convenient. Overall, it's a reliable and effective choice for achieving glowing, healthy skin.

It really helped in clearing up some stubborn acne and improved my skin texture after a few uses. My skin felt smoother and looked brighter. However, this is a strong product, so I‚Äôd recommend starting slow if you have sensitive skin. Make sure to follow up with sunscreen, as it can make your skin more sensitive to the sun.

Like most peeling solutions available, this is also pink in color and slightly sticky. It caused slight irritation on the skin but it was tolerable in my experience .The result was instant and very satisfactory in my two times usage over last 3 weeks. So far, I'm happy with the results

Minimalist 2% Alpha Arbutin Serum for Pigmentation & Dark Spots Removal | Anti-pigmentation Face Serum with Hyaluronic Acid to Remove Blemishes, Acne Marks & Tanning | 30 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is a must try serum. Works so well and so fast, it is great for pigmentation you can start seeing changes within a week. I would suggest using it only at night after cleansing and toner. It has a very light texture and also moisturizes your skin. 2-3 drops are enough. It has a little chemical smell but not strong. It is worth buying. üëç

Minimalist 2% Alpha Arbutin Serum for Pigmentation & Dark Spots Removal | Anti-pigmentation Face Serum with Hyaluronic Acid to Remove Blemishes, Acne Marks & Tanning | 30 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,Let me first tell you that I am a skeptic and I was quite reluctant to try to try it out as I have a very sensitive skin and I have to think 100 times before trying out a product.

But my experience with Minimalist's sunscreen was fantastic and I was still struggling with a lot of pigmentation so I gave it a shot, scared.

Lo and behold, after the first use I could see the difference. Although I gave myself the benefit of doubt and considered it to be Placebo.

Almost a week after trying, I can now confidently say it has worked. It has worked really well on my skin.

There was a stubborn sun tan mark on my forehead for about an year and pigmentation on my nose for almost 5-7 years. Both the marks have faded about 70-80% after 10 days of regular use.

I don't follow a routine, I simply clean my face with a face wash and apply the serum BEFORE sleeping and wash it off in the morning so I leave it there for a good 6-8 hours everyday.

If you are wondering whether you should try it or not, purchase the smaller one (10 ml) which is what I did and then if it works, go ahead with the bigger bottle.

Try it out yourself, I don't usually write reviews but this was worth my time and money so leaving it here for your reference.

If it feels like I was paid to write this review, skip this one and read others because no way in hell I can prove that I was not.

All the best, happy skin care! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Minimalist 2% Alpha Arbutin Serum for Pigmentation & Dark Spots Removal | Anti-pigmentation Face Serum with Hyaluronic Acid to Remove Blemishes, Acne Marks & Tanning | 30 ml,3.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this 3-4 months ago. I am using this during night skincare routine, 4 times a week. I have pigmentation around the lips which have lightened a little bit after 4 months usage. The bottle quantity will go for another 1 month before it's get finished. Pros- Gives me a soft skin and a healthy glow in the morning. If I skip this serum in the night skincare routine, my face looks a bit dull in the morning. So for me definitely this serum helps to give that healthy glow in the morning.
Cons- very slow effect on pigmentation & dark spots. You can't even notice the difference if you don't compare the before-and-after 4 months images.

Minimalist 2% Alpha Arbutin Serum for Pigmentation & Dark Spots Removal | Anti-pigmentation Face Serum with Hyaluronic Acid to Remove Blemishes, Acne Marks & Tanning | 30 ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,It did made my skin soft and brighter, it didn't faded the dark spots entirely until now though. It's a good product but it burns my skin a little (maybe bcuz I have extremely sensitive skin) and I can smell the chemical fragrance a bit.
It does makes your skin better, so it's definitely wasn't a waste of money.
The burning was also not much of an inconvenience bcuz it would go away soon after applying the moisturiser

Minimalist 2% Alpha Arbutin Serum for Pigmentation & Dark Spots Removal | Anti-pigmentation Face Serum with Hyaluronic Acid to Remove Blemishes, Acne Marks & Tanning | 30 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is a must try serum. Works so well and so fast, it is great for pigmentation you can start seeing changes within a week. I would suggest using it only at night after cleansing and toner. It has a very light texture and also moisturizes your skin. 2-3 drops are enough. It has a little chemical smell but not strong. It is worth buying. üëç

Minimalist 2% Alpha Arbutin Serum for Pigmentation & Dark Spots Removal | Anti-pigmentation Face Serum with Hyaluronic Acid to Remove Blemishes, Acne Marks & Tanning | 30 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,Let me first tell you that I am a skeptic and I was quite reluctant to try to try it out as I have a very sensitive skin and I have to think 100 times before trying out a product.

But my experience with Minimalist's sunscreen was fantastic and I was still struggling with a lot of pigmentation so I gave it a shot, scared.

Lo and behold, after the first use I could see the difference. Although I gave myself the benefit of doubt and considered it to be Placebo.

Almost a week after trying, I can now confidently say it has worked. It has worked really well on my skin.

Minimalist 16% Vitamin C Face Serum (Advanced) With Vit E, & Ferulic Acid For Glowing Skin | Advanced Brightening Formula With Power of Vit C & E, Ferulic Acid & Fullerenes | 20ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a well-formulated 15% EAA serum, most EAA serums are waterless using propanediol as a base the result is a sticky formula which I found comedogenic. e.g. the sticky formulas were Ordinary, Niod and facetheory, in all of these cases I threw the product away within 1-2 weeks.
This is a water-based EAA that is fast absorbing, non-comedogenic and gentle. I had no stinging sensation despite the use of tretinoin 0.05% three times a week in the evening. I use the vitamin C in the morning.
My main issue is result is slower than with L-ascorbic, but that is for all derivatives of vitamin C, so you need to be patient.
I used this product on its own for about two weeks, but I have started layering it over the G and G 15% LAA. This combo is giving me brightness and glow. I layer because I find 15% LAA does not take care of the hyperpigmentation like 20% LAA.
In my opinion, EAA is the best derivative so far, 2nd option is SAP.

Cons :
Since they already have a 10% EAA, why not make a 20% EAA instead 15% EAA
20mls is just too small - will get less than one month of use if using daily

This is the best EAA formulation. I have purchased 2nd bottle, and will purchase my 3rd to have as a backup

Minimalist 16% Vitamin C Face Serum (Advanced) With Vit E, & Ferulic Acid For Glowing Skin | Advanced Brightening Formula With Power of Vit C & E, Ferulic Acid & Fullerenes | 20ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a well-formulated 15% EAA serum, most EAA serums are waterless using propanediol as a base the result is a sticky formula which I found comedogenic. e.g. the sticky formulas were Ordinary, Niod and facetheory, in all of these cases I threw the product away within 1-2 weeks.
This is a water-based EAA that is fast absorbing, non-comedogenic and gentle. I had no stinging sensation despite the use of tretinoin 0.05% three times a week in the evening. I use the vitamin C in the morning.
My main issue is result is slower than with L-ascorbic, but that is for all derivatives of vitamin C, so you need to be patient.
I used this product on its own for about two weeks, but I have started layering it over the G and G 15% LAA. This combo is giving me brightness and glow. I layer because I find 15% LAA does not take care of the hyperpigmentation like 20% LAA.
In my opinion, EAA is the best derivative so far, 2nd option is SAP.

Cons :
Since they already have a 10% EAA, why not make a 20% EAA instead 15% EAA
20mls is just too small - will get less than one month of use if using daily

This is the best EAA formulation. I have purchased 2nd bottle, and will purchase my 3rd to have as a backup

Vaseline Healthy Bright, Sun + Pollution Protection Daily Moisturizer, 400ml, for Glowing Skin, 2-in-1 Body Lotion with SPF 30, Fast Absorbing and Non-sticky, for Dry Skin, for Men & Women,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am here to order the product again and write a review after using it for 4 months daily. The smell is good but does not last long. Its texture is like Butter, so thick, creamy, soft and nourishing. Felt like body butter. It easily gets absorbed in the skin. The next day when you shower, you can still feel the product on your skin, that's how long-lasting it is. It does protect from the sun for 3-4 hours but you will have to reapply it after that. Do not leave the white cast. A highly recommended product.

It lasts very long and I did got rid of my pimples and blackheads after using it. My skin looks and feels great! It has value for money and works wonders. Really happy with the results. But before recommending I would like to make a strong point that this product doesn‚Äôt works on everyone‚Äôs skin. On some people it doesn‚Äôt suits well or ends up disturbing their skin barrier. So it‚Äôs better if you try a small patch on my hand/wrist first and check how it goes or try introducing it in your skincare routine slowly like twice a week and then increase the amount slowly when it starts adjusting to your skin.
You will find a lot of information regarding that on youtube or anywhere on the internet so always order after a through research! But if you are like me whose skin can adjust easily then its a must try!

The Derma Co 2% Salicylic Acid Serum | Witch Hazel & Willow Bark | For Active Acne I Controls Sebum Production & Prevents Skin Damage I BHA Based Exfoliant for Acne Prone & Oily Skin ‚Äì 30ml,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Derma Co 2% Salicylic Acid Serum with Witch Hazel & Willow Bark is a decent option for addressing active acne. The 2% salicylic acid concentration helps to exfoliate the skin and unclog pores, potentially reducing breakouts over time. The addition of witch hazel and willow bark adds some soothing properties, which can be beneficial for calming irritated skin. However, the 10ml size is relatively small, so it may not last long with regular use. While it delivers noticeable results, especially for those with mild to moderate acne, it may not be as potent as higher-strength treatments for more severe cases. Overall, it‚Äôs a good addition to an acne regimen but might require supplementing with other products for more significant results.

The Derma Co 2% Salicylic Acid Serum | Witch Hazel & Willow Bark | For Active Acne I Controls Sebum Production & Prevents Skin Damage I BHA Based Exfoliant for Acne Prone & Oily Skin ‚Äì 30ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have been using this serum from may of 2023 and all I can say about it is it's absolutely worth the money !!

At first I used to apply it once a week in my pm routine as I was scared how it would react to my skin (sensitive combination skin.)

So now, i did not instantly have the CLEAREST skin instead I had more texture and bumpy skin, my skin was filled with tiny little bumps (it's common for me, I breakout like this on my skin from time to time)

I was scared and wanted to stop using it but the internet said it's common and continued use would help me see better results.

I used it for quite a while and then my skin cleared up, I increased the frequency of application.

I applied it two times a week and it did improve my complexion and skin texture and helped clear my skin a bit but it did not and still has not done anything for my blackheads and whiteheads. ( I used pore stips and now my nose has become oilier :/ )

Once again, I now applied it everyday (except a few skip days because I'm lazy) and I see IMMENSE jump in my skin health, it was so bumpy, textury, dull, etc but now my skin looks healthy although it still needs time to clear out because I recently had bad acne but the serum really does work like it's my first active that I'm using so I'm just real happy with my results ngl it just makes your skin clear, and you GLOW like a light bulb also the smell at first was noticeable and ew for me but now I'm accustomed to it so it smells like nothing and the serum absorps pretty well and quickly into the skin too.

ITS A PLUSSS

You should always patch test before using it although I didn't i was so excited when I received it that I jumped into application.

And I did buy it after a lot of research, watching reviews on YouTube, nykaa, Amazon, reading articles, and rethinking about a 100 times but it's all worth it bestie buy it now !!

Note: it gets just a TINY bit sticky-ish after you apply but after you let it absorb it's all nice and you look cute ;) and OBVIOUSLY SUNSCREEN I still only use it at night so next day I make SURE that I absolutely HAVE MY SUNSCREEN ON BEFORE I STEP OUT FOR BATTLE ü¶∏‚òÄÔ∏è

WOW Skin Science 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel for Face, Skin & Hair - 150ml | Ultimate Gel For Glowing Skin | For Both Men and Women,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the Wow Aloe Vera Gel and I have been absolutely loving it. The gel has a light and refreshing texture that absorbs quickly into my skin, leaving it feeling hydrated and nourished.

I have been using this gel both on my face and body and I have noticed a significant improvement in the overall texture and appearance of my skin. The aloe vera in the gel has soothing properties that have helped calm any redness or irritation on my skin. What amazes me the most is there is no Fragnance I am allergic to the alovera smell this product is absolutely the best one it has no Fragnance in it.

I also love that this gel makes my skin soft and bright I usually mix alovera gel in masks like rice flour it gives very hydrating look to my skin.
And I absolutely love the packing it's very convenient to use and doesn't make it messy while I use.

Overall, I highly recommend the Wow Aloe Vera Gel to anyone looking for a natural and effective skincare product. It has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine and I will definitely be repurchasing it in the future.

It can stick hair in place as an alternative to chemically polluted hair gel. Bottle also looked cool! The smell is also really pleasant and isn‚Äôt too overpowering.

WOW Skin Science 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel for Face, Skin & Hair - 150ml | Ultimate Gel For Glowing Skin | For Both Men and Women,4.0 out of 5 stars,The texture of this gel is light and non-sticky, which I really appreciate. It's chemical-free, making it a good choice for natural skincare. However, I‚Äôm not a fan of the scent. I‚Äôve been using it for the past 3 months, combined with vitamin E tablets, as part of my night skincare routine to repair daily damage from dust and sun exposure. Despite the smell, it‚Äôs been effective for my skin.

WOW Skin Science 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel for Face, Skin & Hair - 150ml | Ultimate Gel For Glowing Skin | For Both Men and Women,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently tried the Wow Skin Aloe Vera Gel, and I‚Äôm very impressed. The texture is smooth and absorbs quickly into the skin without any greasiness. Its thickness is just right, providing effective hydration. What stood out the most is that it has no added fragrance or color, making it feel like genuine, pure aloe vera. For the price, this gel offers great value and non Sticky when applied.

WOW Skin Science 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel for Face, Skin & Hair - 150ml | Ultimate Gel For Glowing Skin | For Both Men and Women,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the Wow Aloe Vera Gel and I have been absolutely loving it. The gel has a light and refreshing texture that absorbs quickly into my skin, leaving it feeling hydrated and nourished.

I have been using this gel both on my face and body and I have noticed a significant improvement in the overall texture and appearance of my skin. The aloe vera in the gel has soothing properties that have helped calm any redness or irritation on my skin. What amazes me the most is there is no Fragnance I am allergic to the alovera smell this product is absolutely the best one it has no Fragnance in it.

I also love that this gel makes my skin soft and bright I usually mix alovera gel in masks like rice flour it gives very hydrating look to my skin.
And I absolutely love the packing it's very convenient to use and doesn't make it messy while I use.

Overall, I highly recommend the Wow Aloe Vera Gel to anyone looking for a natural and effective skincare product. It has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine and I will definitely be repurchasing it in the future.

,Fatima Mirza
POND'S Bb+ Cream, Instant Spot Coverage + Light Make-Up Glow, Ivory 30G, Natural,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am 49 years old. I have red circles under my eyes because of a medication I take (it increases blood flow to eye area). I was searching for a good foundation or concealer for my eyes, to cover this issue. I have L'Oreal, which gives very low coverage and seems overpriced for the kind of coverage it offers. I also use dermacol, which is the most amazing full coverage miracle foundation, but it is Rs 1999 now, too pricey, and not suitable for daily use because it is quite heavy. So I started my search and began to look for youtube reviews.
One reviewer was talking about this BB cream and said it gives better coverage than some Rs 600 foundation she was reviewing. I was shocked and looked it up. It was so cheap that I decided to buy it.
And the result, you can see for yourself. It has nicely covered the red circles and the veins under my eyes.
It is really much better than I was expecting.
Thank you ponds for this great product, thank you amazon for this great discounted price for the 30 grams tube.

Update: Even after cycling 10 Kms and hiking 1 hour, most of it stays in place and doesn't come off. Pat your skin dry gently with a handkerchief or a tissue. Some of it will come off but you will still have good coverage and look fresh!

Es handelt sich um eine schmale Tune (ca. Gr√∂sse einer Augencreme-Tune), Inhalt 18 Gramm (ich sch√§tze, das entspricht in etwa 15-20ml). Der Farbton ist angenehm gelblich, tendenziell - im Vergleich zu den hier erh√§ltlichen BB-Cremes - eher dunkel (wem es hilft: ca. MAC NC30) und dezent abdeckend. Solo reicht mir die Creme pflegetechnisch nicht aus; ich habe trockene Mischhaut. Der enthaltene Lichtschutzfaktor 30 ist ein tolles Benefiz, auf das ich mich als alleinigen Sonnenschutz jedoch nicht verlasse, weil man gerade bei Makeup und get√∂nter Creme etc. niemals auf die empfohlene Auftragsmenge kommt, um den angegebenen Faktor zu erreichen. Alles in allem ist das eine tolle BB-Cream, die ich gerne weiterempfehle und sicherlich auch nachkaufen werde!
Ebenso ein grosses Lob f√ºr den Verk√§ufer!

POND'S Bb+ Cream, Instant Spot Coverage + Light Make-Up Glow, Ivory 30G, Natural,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am 49 years old. I have red circles under my eyes because of a medication I take (it increases blood flow to eye area). I was searching for a good foundation or concealer for my eyes, to cover this issue. I have L'Oreal, which gives very low coverage and seems overpriced for the kind of coverage it offers. I also use dermacol, which is the most amazing full coverage miracle foundation, but it is Rs 1999 now, too pricey, and not suitable for daily use because it is quite heavy. So I started my search and began to look for youtube reviews.
One reviewer was talking about this BB cream and said it gives better coverage than some Rs 600 foundation she was reviewing. I was shocked and looked it up. It was so cheap that I decided to buy it.
And the result, you can see for yourself. It has nicely covered the red circles and the veins under my eyes.
It is really much better than I was expecting.
Thank you ponds for this great product, thank you amazon for this great discounted price for the 30 grams tube.

Update: Even after cycling 10 Kms and hiking 1 hour, most of it stays in place and doesn't come off. Pat your skin dry gently with a handkerchief or a tissue. Some of it will come off but you will still have good coverage and look fresh!

RE' EQUIL Ceramide & Hyaluronic Acid Moisturiser | Moisturizer For Face | Barrier Repair Cream | Long Lasting Hydration | Suitable For Normal To Dry Skin | 100G,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this cream because I love ceramides in my moisturizers and I loved Oryza but it was too expensive to apply everyday. I can confidently say that this cream exceeded my expectations. It's creamy and thick, and the formulation is very nice. It's is a bit heavy on the skin and takes 5 mins to absorb, so it is ideal for winters. It leaves my skin soft and hydrated and did not cause any adverse reactions for me, even on my sensitive, acne prone skin. A little quantity goes a long way. The quantity is perfect, I would definitely even buy the 200gm tube the next time, it's very easy to use and hygienic due to its tube packaging. Highly recommend 9/10

RE' EQUIL Ceramide & Hyaluronic Acid Moisturiser | Moisturizer For Face | Barrier Repair Cream | Long Lasting Hydration | Suitable For Normal To Dry Skin | 100G,3.0 out of 5 stars,The price is good for the quality and quantity.
It's a slightly heavy cream that's ideal for dry weather. The best part is that it suits sensitive skin, does not sting at all but be careful about not getting it into the eyes. I have only used it for 2-3 days and it didn't break me out. The fragrance is very mild and pleasant. The tube makes it very convenient and easy to dispense the cream. I will update my review later if my opinion changes. So far so good.

Edit- after a week : the cream has a waxy texture. It is not as moisturizing as I had hoped because it sits on top of the skin like a coating rather than getting absorbed. Won't buy again.

Re'quil moisturizer is soothing and has a mild fragrance . I think it moisturizes quite well. I will update this review after using it for 2 weeks . Lets see....

Edit: after two weeks I would its a pretty good ceramide moisturizer , it not only helped me with my hella dry skin but also it also reduced the redness and acne . But i wanna point out sm that for me its winter moisturizer , in summer it leaves sweat on forehead and chin .

L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Serum, Hydrating and Plumping, With 1.5% Hyaluronic Acid, 15ml,2.0 out of 5 stars,The image of this product looks like the larger 30mL bottle. I recognise now that the description says 15mL, but the image is misleading. I also received a bottle where the label looks like it has rubbed off, and I don‚Äôt feel particularly confident about the legitimacy of the product (pictured on second image is the comparison to my empty 30mL bottle). $20 for the 15mL isn‚Äôt great value - I‚Äôve previously purchased the 30mL for the same price on sale (hence the assumption that this was the larger bottle).

L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Serum, Hydrating and Plumping, With 1.5% Hyaluronic Acid, 15ml,1.0 out of 5 stars,I have used this product thrice before and bought it from nykaa or offline stores, but it was my 4th bottle and first time when I ordered from Amazon , clearly the bottle that came was light lavender colour than the empty bottle I already had, anyone can see the difference between both the bottle, my earlier serum was quite thick and gave soft finishing after use but this one it is very funny as if its water , plus after applying it give a glue like effect skin becomes dry and dull, it's a hydraulic acid which must promote hydration but this one don't, please don't but this product, maximum beauty products on Amazon are fake..duplicate , my skin have became..very dry now... plus small black spots have starting coming on....it's a ..bad allergy

L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Serum, Hydrating and Plumping, With 1.5% Hyaluronic Acid, 15ml,2.0 out of 5 stars,The image of this product looks like the larger 30mL bottle. I recognise now that the description says 15mL, but the image is misleading. I also received a bottle where the label looks like it has rubbed off, and I don‚Äôt feel particularly confident about the legitimacy of the product (pictured on second image is the comparison to my empty 30mL bottle). $20 for the 15mL isn‚Äôt great value - I‚Äôve previously purchased the 30mL for the same price on sale (hence the assumption that this was the larger bottle).

Lakme Peach Milk, Soft Creme Face Moisturizer, 100g, for Soft, Glowing Skin, with Vitamin E & Peach Milk Extract, 24Hr Moisture Lock, Lightweight, Non-Sticky, Non-Oily, All Skin Types,5.0 out of 5 stars,LAKME PEACH MILK CREME:

I recently purchased Lakme Peach Milk Creme for my mom, and she's been loving it. This lightweight moisturizer has a luxurious texture that absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving it feeling hydrated and soft. The pleasant peach scent adds a touch of luxury to the experience.
One of the things my mom appreciates most about this cream is its ability to provide a natural, dewy finish. It nourishes the skin without feeling greasy, making it suitable for all skin types.
She typically applies it at night as part of her skincare routine, but it can be used anytime and anywhere as needed.

Overall, I highly recommend Lakme Peach Milk Creme to anyone looking for a hydrating and nourishing moisturizer.

One of the standout features of this serum is its lightweight, non-greasy formula. It absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling refreshed and never oily.

Vaseline Gluta-Hya Flawless Glow Lotion | For Face & Body |Bright & Eventone Skin | Glutathione & Pro-Retinol Infused Moisturizer 200ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this for my wife. She has been struggling with dark spots and dull, uneven skin tone, but Vaseline Gluta-Hya serum-in-lotion has been a total game changer for her. With its powerful GlutaGlow technology and Pro-Retinol exfoliating properties, her skin has never looked more even and radiant. She also loved that it's super hydrating thanks to the Hyaluron, which makes the skin look dewy and youthful. The texture is amazing too - it's not too heavy or greasy, and it absorbs quickly so anyone can apply makeup right after. Overall, I'd highly recommend this product to anyone looking to brighten their complexion and improve their overall skin health. It's truly a miracle product!

I recommend using a thicker lotion on top if you have dry skin or even eczema. I use the La Roche posey with niacinamide on top and my skin remains so soft nd bright for so long that I keep rubbing my legs LMAOOOOO my skin is just so soft!!!!!

Vaseline Gluta-Hya Flawless Glow Lotion | For Face & Body |Bright & Eventone Skin | Glutathione & Pro-Retinol Infused Moisturizer 200ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,Please note this is not a "Moisturizing" lotion, it literally feels like a serum for the body. I recommend adding a shower oil to your routine. I also use a Kojic Acid soap. However I do I see a a difference in the hyperpigmentation that was on my back after about 5 days of use! Get it!

Vaseline Gluta-Hya Flawless Glow Lotion | For Face & Body |Bright & Eventone Skin | Glutathione & Pro-Retinol Infused Moisturizer 200ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's nice, haven't seen results yet but that's because I'm not consistent. I would say the smell isn't perfumey or anything, it just smell like a lotion. I will say tho, don't expect this to hydrate your skin it is just a serum for your body like your face you need to put a lotion after towards, and if you want to be extra you and add an oil on top of that.

Vaseline Gluta-Hya Flawless Glow Lotion | For Face & Body |Bright & Eventone Skin | Glutathione & Pro-Retinol Infused Moisturizer 200ml,4.0 out of 5 stars,It absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn't not have scent. It brightens the skin for some minutes when applied. Have applied for few months, but it does not change the original skin tone much.
When applied on face it gives a little itchy and tingling sensation for few minutes but not when I apply it on hand or neck.
Light in texture, worth purchasing.

Vaseline Gluta-Hya Flawless Glow Lotion | For Face & Body |Bright & Eventone Skin | Glutathione & Pro-Retinol Infused Moisturizer 200ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this for my wife. She has been struggling with dark spots and dull, uneven skin tone, but Vaseline Gluta-Hya serum-in-lotion has been a total game changer for her. With its powerful GlutaGlow technology and Pro-Retinol exfoliating properties, her skin has never looked more even and radiant. She also loved that it's super hydrating thanks to the Hyaluron, which makes the skin look dewy and youthful. The texture is amazing too - it's not too heavy or greasy, and it absorbs quickly so anyone can apply makeup right after. Overall, I'd highly recommend this product to anyone looking to brighten their complexion and improve their overall skin health. It's truly a miracle product!

I was skeptical at first that the "gel" would somehow be sticky or too thick, but this goes on like a dream and really protects. It also features a moderate SPF of 30 rather than the over-the-top numbers that are now edging toward triple digits.

Minimalist Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++ | Clinically Tested in US (In-Vivo) | Lightweight with Multi-Vitamins | No White Cast | Broad Spectrum | For Women & Men | 50g,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the Minimalist Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++ from Amazon, and I am beyond impressed with its performance. In a world filled with skincare products claiming to do it all, this sunscreen truly stands out for its simplicity and efficacy.

First and foremost, let's talk about protection. With SPF 50 and PA++++ rating, this sunscreen offers maximum defense against harmful UVA and UVB rays, shielding my skin from sun damage and premature aging. Whether I'm running errands or spending a day at the beach, I trust this sunscreen to keep my skin safe and healthy.

What sets this product apart is its minimalist formula. Free from harsh chemicals and fragrances, it's gentle even on sensitive skin like mine. The lightweight texture absorbs quickly without leaving behind any greasy residue or white cast, making it perfect for daily wear under makeup or alone.

I also appreciate the long-lasting hydration it provides. Infused with nourishing ingredients like hyaluronic acid and vitamin E, it not only protects my skin from the sun but also keeps it moisturized throughout the day. No more worrying about dryness or discomfort, even in harsh weather conditions.

Another highlight of this sunscreen is its versatility. It's suitable for all skin types, including oily and acne-prone skin. I've noticed that it doesn't clog pores or cause breakouts, making it a staple in my skincare routine year-round.

In terms of packaging, the sleek and travel-friendly tube is a bonus. It's easy to throw in my bag and carry with me wherever I go, ensuring I never skip sun protection, no matter the occasion.

Overall, I can't recommend the Minimalist Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++ enough. It's everything I look for in a sunscreen‚Äîeffective, gentle, and fuss-free. If you're in search of a reliable daily sunscreen that delivers on its promises, look no further than this gem from Minimalist.

Pros:

Maximum SPF 50 and PA++++ protection
Gentle, minimalist formula
Lightweight texture with no white cast
Hydrating and suitable for all skin types
Travel-friendly packaging
Cons:

None that I've experienced so far!

WishCare SPF50 Sunscreen Body Lotion - Broad Spectrum - UVA & UVB Protection with No White Cast - With Carrot Seed & Raspberry - For Men & Women - 200 Ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought my second bottle!

Tip: apply until it is well absorbed and dried enough before going outside because it melts easily if you just applied it

Dot & Key Watermelon Hyaluronic Cooling Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++| for Oily, Normal & Combination Skin | UV + Blue Light Protection | Lightweight | No White Cast | Boosts Vitamin D Absorption | 50g‚Ä¶,5.0 out of 5 stars,the best formulation as a sunscreen but don't consider this to be water or sweat proof and if you refuse to use any sunscreen because its oily or produce sebum do this after wearing this sunscreen wait for 5 mins and wear a mattifing powder or compact. This has a cooling sensation too so dewy is acceptable for me.

Here‚Äôs why:1. Lightweight & Non-Greasy:
This sunscreen is incredibly lightweight and doesn‚Äôt leave that heavy, greasy feeling that many sunscreens do. It absorbs quickly into the skin, making it perfect for layering under makeup or just wearing on its own.2. Broad-Spectrum Protection:
The SPF 50 PA+++ offers robust protection against both UVA and UVB rays. I spend a lot of time outdoors, and this sunscreen has done an excellent job of keeping my skin safe from sun damage.3. No White Cast:
One of the standout features of the Foxtale Golden Hour Sunscreen is that it leaves no white cast. This is especially important for those with medium to dark skin tones who often struggle to find sunscreens that don‚Äôt leave a chalky residue.4. Hydrating Formula:
My skin feels hydrated and soft after applying this sunscreen, thanks to the inclusion of hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid. It‚Äôs great for those with dry or combination skin.5. Gentle on the Skin:
I have sensitive skin and have had no issues with irritation or breakouts since using this product. It‚Äôs fragrance-free and contains no harsh chemicals, making it a great option for sensitive skin types.

Beauty of Joseon [Beauty Of Joseon] 50 Spf Relief Sun Set For All Skin Type Of 1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Okay. I JUST started using this sunscreen yesterday and immediately it's an easy 5 stars! I currently use Isntree Hyaluronic Watery Sun Gel and I like it a lot, especially during winters.

But in Indian summers when it's a gazillion degrees out and humid, it sometimes tends to feel super heavy and greasy on the skin.

And the skincare gods answer to that seems to be this BoJs Sun Relief! Its so lightweight and makes my skin look all glassy and shiny without weighing it down. I'll have to use it for a while to determine if it does a good job of protecting as well as the Isntree one so jury's still out on that.

But just interms of how it sits on my skin and under my makeup? Yes YES YESSSSS!!!

I'll probably come back in a month's time to drop a usage review.

Aqualogica Dewy Sunscreen SPF 50 With Watermelon For All Skin & Niacinamide 50.0 Gm Bottle, 1 Count,1.0 out of 5 stars,The most negetive point is that its quantity;only a little amount was there for such huge price.
They said it suits for every skin, but my skin became more oily when i applied it; i always apply sunscreen after facewash. After applying this sunscreen my face became oily and greasy. It was really uncomfortable.
This sunsreen gives a small amount of white cast as it didnt blend well with my oily skin.
It gave a veryy good protection and i am sure it will suit for dry and normal skin types. But i don't recomend this for oily and combination skin types.
I have acne on my face but this sunscreen didn't lead to anykind of breakouts etc.
Safe to use for acneprone dry or normal skin types.
My product had pumping issue...i used to open it and dip my fingers inorder to apply it.
Its a 2star product for me because of my oily skin type.

Aqualogica Dewy Sunscreen SPF 50 With Watermelon For All Skin & Niacinamide 50.0 Gm Bottle, 1 Count,1.0 out of 5 stars,The most negetive point is that its quantity;only a little amount was there for such huge price.
They said it suits for every skin, but my skin became more oily when i applied it; i always apply sunscreen after facewash. After applying this sunscreen my face became oily and greasy. It was really uncomfortable.
This sunsreen gives a small amount of white cast as it didnt blend well with my oily skin.
It gave a veryy good protection and i am sure it will suit for dry and normal skin types. But i don't recomend this for oily and combination skin types.
I have acne on my face but this sunscreen didn't lead to anykind of breakouts etc.
Safe to use for acneprone dry or normal skin types.
My product had pumping issue...i used to open it and dip my fingers inorder to apply it.
Its a 2star product for me because of my oily skin type.

Reasons are many, but the most important ones are that it is very easy to apply and reapply as it comes in spray from, its sun protection factor is 60 which is way higher than any other product available, it leaves no white cast that is a common problem with normal sunscreens and it comes with skin hydrating and nourishing oils that not only protect skin from sun rays but also from pollution.

SunScoop Invisible Body SPF 60 PA++++ Sunscreen Spray For Women & Men With UV Filters Avobenzone & Octocrylene | Non-Comedogenic, Broad Spectrum, No White Cast | For Oily & Dry Skin | 125mL,5.0 out of 5 stars,If I have to apply something on my face everyday, multiple times, it would be only "Sun Scoop's spf 60". Reasons are many, but the most important ones are that it is very easy to apply and reapply as it comes in spray from, its sun protection factor is 60 which is way higher than any other product available, it leaves no white cast that is a common problem with normal sunscreens and it comes with skin hydrating and nourishing oils that not only protect skin from sun rays but also from pollution. I've been using it quiet long and it is really a woww product ‚ù§Ô∏è Highly recommended ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

The texture of the cream is great, not heavy or dense, it has a lovely and very light sandalwood scent that my husband raves about. It's not greasy at all, it does not leave a white film on the skin and most importantly for me, I can wear it along with my daily moisturizer. My husband and I share this cream daily, only wished it came in a bigger, family size bottle. It's an all around great product.

Price is reasonable.

Cetaphil Combination Skin Sun Spf 50 Sunscreen, Very High Protection Light Gel, Water Resistant, Vitamin E, 50 Ml, Pack Of 1,3.0 out of 5 stars,The sunscreen is pretty thick and comes in a tube. It's not very easy to apply. On my skin, it left a white cast which takes almost 30 mins to absorb. Once absorbed, it gavena decent glowy finish.

Best to avoid applying this on the eye contour area and even touching your eyes after applying this. It really stings your eyes.

I was skeptical at first that the "gel" would somehow be sticky or too thick, but this goes on like a dream and really protects. It also features a moderate SPF of 30 rather than the over-the-top numbers that are now edging toward triple digits.

,Useless cream,theek is not any effect of this cream ony face ,,I have been using it from last 3 weeks....it's totally waste buying it
Lacto Calamine Sunscreen SPF 50 | 50g | PA +++ Sunscreen For Oily Skin | UVA ‚Äì UVB Sunscreen | Water Resistant & No White Cast | With Kaolin Clay, Vitamin E & Lemon Extracts | Paraben Free,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought the sunscreen and tested on forehand as it was recommended to ensure if there is any irritation or not. No irritation. That's good!
I have applied sunscreen on my forehand and after 15 mins, dropped 2 drops of water on it. It turned into whitish colour which is visible on skin. You can look at the picture for reference. I don't know about the effect on skin yet, since it's my first day. However, it's definitely not water resistant. If you sweat, you know how your skin looks.
Thank you for reading!

Update: I have been using it for almost a month now! Matte finish is really good. Does not leave a trace of sunscreen on your face until you are not sweating. However, if you sweat, a white layer will be seen on forehead. You always need a hand kerchief when it's too hot outside.

Lacto Calamine Sunscreen SPF 50 | 50g | PA +++ Sunscreen For Oily Skin | UVA ‚Äì UVB Sunscreen | Water Resistant & No White Cast | With Kaolin Clay, Vitamin E & Lemon Extracts | Paraben Free,2.0 out of 5 stars,I usually like the Lacto Calamine products since they are sensitive on the skin and do not cause any damages. I regularly use the Cleansing Toner, the 10% Niacinamide and the Vitamin C Serums and the Green Tea Night Gel Moisturizer and have been liking it. I recently bought the Lacto Calamine Sunscreen lotion. Unlike the brand claims, the lotion is greasy and does not leave a matte finish on the skin. It is a mammoth task to get the lotion to blend into the skin and will easily take about five minutes of working to get it absorbed. I bought this water-resistant lotion to use it for my morning jogs. But I manage to get myself a mini workout just applying and blending the lotion into the skin before stepping out for the jog. Mine is a combination to oily skin type and I have to top this lotion application with a sunscreen powder or a compact to get the matte finish look. The label claims that it is suitable for oily skin people, but it doesn't work for me. Those with oily skin and living in humid weather conditions like in Mumbai, you may want to give it a pass unless you have the patience, endurance and the time to get this lotion to blend into the skin.

Update after two weeks of use: This sunscreen gave me breakouts and I must say I will definitely not recommend it to anyone with oily or combination skin type. I had initially rated this product 3/5 but reducing the rating to 2/5 with this review update.

RENEE Pore Minimizing Sunscreen Spf 70 With 2% Niacinamide For All Skins, 2% Peptide & 3% Multivitamins, 50Ml,3.0 out of 5 stars,This is a review after a few weeks and an honest one, so the sunscreen is fine not very good as said by people but protects from the sun just a little bit, has a subtle fragrance which isn't very pleasant to me. But the thing that I like about this sunsceen was that my face didn't get oily after sometime as it used to do when I applied dr. Sheths ceramide and vit c sunscreen and of course didn't cause any break outs either which I had had when I was using dr. Sheths. So it is a fine one and it exactly does not protects you from the sun but just a little bit as Igot tanned after using it.

I've tried many face creams in the past, but this one is definitely my new favorite. It's perfect for my dry skin, and I've even noticed an improvement in skin tone and texture. I've gotten so many compliments on my skin since I started using it!

The best part? It's affordable and cruelty-free, making it a win-win in my book. I highly recommend this face cream to anyone looking for a high

Biotique Morning Nectar Sun Protect Moisturizer SPF 30 UVA/UVB Sunscreen| Contains Wild Turmeric, Neem Leaves, & Morning Nectar | Visibly Flawless Skin | Suitable for All Skin Types | 120 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,OMG! I am a beauty fanatic and have tons of lotions and potions. I have used Lancome, Clinique and ROC but this product from Biotique is 100% better! Let me explain why...First I am 34 years old and still have some acne scars from when I was in my teens. I am olive complected & have tried almost every dark skin corrector out there but nothing worked! Clinique's Dark Spot Corrector was a dud & I was swindled out of $49.50! That product did nothing for my skin. This Biotique lotion drastically faded my scars and I have only been using it for a few days! I have also noticed that my skin is smoother and my pores are practically invisible. I also love the herbal smell of this product and appreciate that this is a natural, ayurvedic product. This product is pretty cheap but you are really getting a steal because of how this lotion packs such a powerful punch. LOVE it!! I would definitely buy this product again from this seller.

Biotique Morning Nectar Sun Protect Moisturizer SPF 30 UVA/UVB Sunscreen| Contains Wild Turmeric, Neem Leaves, & Morning Nectar | Visibly Flawless Skin | Suitable for All Skin Types | 120 ml,5.0 out of 5 stars,OMG! I am a beauty fanatic and have tons of lotions and potions. I have used Lancome, Clinique and ROC but this product from Biotique is 100% better! Let me explain why...First I am 34 years old and still have some acne scars from when I was in my teens. I am olive complected & have tried almost every dark skin corrector out there but nothing worked! Clinique's Dark Spot Corrector was a dud & I was swindled out of $49.50! That product did nothing for my skin. This Biotique lotion drastically faded my scars and I have only been using it for a few days! I have also noticed that my skin is smoother and my pores are practically invisible. I also love the herbal smell of this product and appreciate that this is a natural, ayurvedic product. This product is pretty cheap but you are really getting a steal because of how this lotion packs such a powerful punch. LOVE it!! I would definitely buy this product again from this seller.

RE' EQUIL Oxybenzone and OMC Free Sunscreen For Oily, Sensitive & Acne Prone Skin | Prevents Acne Breakouts | No White Cast | SPF 50 PA+++ | 50g,5.0 out of 5 stars,Most sunscreens make my skin feel even more oily, but not this one. RE' EQUIL Sunscreen goes on smooth and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. It's light, so you don't feel like you're wearing a heavy mask. Best part? It doesn't leave that annoying white stuff behind like a lot of other sunscreens do.

Now let's talk about the main thing - it really protects my skin. I'm often out in the strong sun, and this sunscreen has been a real lifesaver. It keeps my skin safe from getting burned and even helps stop signs of aging and damage from the sun. It works against all types of harsh sun rays.

Also, it's perfect to carry around. It fits in my purse easily and it lasts a long time, so I don't have to keep buying a new one every few weeks.

I now use the RE' EQUIL Sunscreen every day and it's been awesome for my oily skin. It keeps my skin protected and doesn't make it shiny or extra oily. If you're dealing with oily skin like me, you should definitely give this sunscreen a try. It's been a big help for me and my skin feels better than ever.

The texture of the cream is great, not heavy or dense, it has a lovely and very light sandalwood scent that my husband raves about. It's not greasy at all, it does not leave a white film on the skin and most importantly for me, I can wear it along with my daily moisturizer. My husband and I share this cream daily, only wished it came in a bigger, family size bottle. It's an all around great product.
