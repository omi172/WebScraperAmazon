WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this product in May-2024, total 3 nos for my different bathroom showers. After almost 3 months of usage. I'm forced to post this review. So everything was fine till date. Even the filter was doing a good job. The problem comes when u want to replace the cartridge or u want to change the position of the cartridge. So 1st time I changed the direction of cartridge from the filter upside down. This is required to be done as per the company's instruction. It took hell lot of ime to do this job..I don't know why they have made this filter and cartridge assembly in such a bad design that u cannot remove the cartridge from the filter. I did this anyhow and second time I tried this today with another filter but the cartridge is not getting separated whatever I tried. If the manufacturer wanted to sell cartridge as a replacement or consumable item then it should have been user friendly. Even entire cartridge got damaged but it didn't come out. I am had Even purchased extra cartridge for this filter..it's a waste for me now..I don't know any other person faced the same problems but this is the worst design i must say. Again the filter is expensive around 2k..u cannot waste this much money for 3-4 months usage.i would request water science team to see this and help me out,Pranav Kankee

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had ordered 2 filters inspite of many bad reviews. One filter is working fine but second has water leaking from the body. Installation is easy but the key tool provided is useless to say the least.
Edit: the filter which was working fine was not used for 15 days and now it has choked. Water is not passing through it. Such useless products seems they are more reliant on paid reviews otherwise there is no explanation to generally good reviews when both the products i recieved were faulty,av123456

Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product to use for once and all. It is for day to day normal use and for normal stain utensils. Thank you.,S.S.
Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),4.0 out of 5 stars,Have always been purchasing the original scotch brite pads since they don't leave behind residue on the plates which we then inevitably digest while eating off plates. Because, let's face it, how much ever we wash the plates, there is always micro-residue from the cheap ripped off scrub pads in the market. The Scotch Brite scrub pads don't degrade like their cheap counterparts and hence last longer.

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this bottle cleaner. This is the second one I have ordered. I have kept one each at my home and my in law's place. It does the job. It does reach the bottom corners of the bottles as claimed. Overall a good one. I use it mostly for the kids bottles. It has a good reach. It dries quickly once you shake off as much water as you can.
The sponge is detachable from the handle as mentioned in the product description, to enable it to be changed once the sponge weras out. Now I haven't checked if the sponge head is available separately. Otherwise this is a bit expensive.,Mom to an autistic kid.
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,The scrubber given is very good and it cleans the milk residue properly , the only issue is that the handle detaches and the scrubber stays the bottle which is very hard to remove,Udayani
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),3.0 out of 5 stars,Suitable for bottles with slightly bigger mouths; though not meant for heavy use, if head gets stuck inside any bottle, its sponge part can come off the handle!,Ajay
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely wonderful product. Exactly what i needed. Perfect cleaning.

Another review mentioned, the scrub coming off if bottle mouth is small... it is a hassle but not a hig one. Having a removable facility ensures that the scrub can be cleaned throughly. So, it is good feature.,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),1.0 out of 5 stars,3rd class quality. Unable to clean the bottles easily. Foam and handle got seperated during cleaning making the cleaning uncomfortable and ineffective. Worst brush,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this bottle cleaner for cleaning steel water bottle. I was facing issue with local brushes where the sponge on the lower part of the brush would get off quickly creating issues in cleaning the bottom of the bottle from inside. Did purchase this product with the hopes that it would solve this issue and the product delivered true to my expectations.

The only downside I see is that if the mouth of the bottle is a bit smaller, there can be issues in getting the brush outside without the risk of cleaning brush stuck inside the bottle.,Shantanu
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,Getting the perfect bottle cleaning brush is a hard task for Mommies. This one does the job well but as the scrubber is loosely attached to the handle..it often comes out while pulling away from smaller bottles.

I suggest Team Scotch Brite to make a smaller one of this for kids feeding bottles.,Aprajita Mishra

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure how long this will last but it is stronger than the usual "bottle brush" as it is made from foam rasher than "brush material"

Night vision: very good
Wireless connectivity: good
Detection: very good.
Notification: very good
Feature: All required features are available.
Bad: when to talk, camera sound quality need to improve. Meaning camera sound system need to improve. But sound captured by camre is very good.
Alarm: good,Rajdeep Sen
Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,4.0 out of 5 stars,Updating my review after one month of use. No change in my rating and just updating more prons and cons

Pros
1. Good indoor camera for normal use.
2. Configuring is easy
3.Tapo app is responsive and working good
4. Video Clarity is ok
5. Sound is ok
6. Rotation is smooth , but a very small sound while rotating. A person who is standing near to camera can notice this sound
7. Zooming is ok , but no optical zoom
8. Night vision is good
9. You can add presets and presets are working good. I am specifically telling this because presets won't work well in some other brand cameraz . But for tapo it is working very good.

10. You can adjust rotation angle and it is one of the feature missing in other camera.

11. Person detection is working well and you can easily differtiate normal motion detection with person detection by a person symbol on thumbnails.

Cons
1. Cloud storage is expensive
2. No optical zoom, only digital zoom. I didn't like zoom clarity compared to other 3mp models. If you want to zoom a large distance , don't take this.i own an ezviz 1k camera and i liked zoom clarity of that than this.
3. Can't control the siren as per our will.siren works only in motion detection. So if a small insect is flying , then it will make sound. But we can restrict it to human detection. I always prefer an alarm with a button which we can trigger from app.
4. Play back or recorded video in memory card fast-forward option is not via slider. You can select a speed and it will fast forward based on that. But I always prefer a slider for fast-forward.

5. Tapo is autorotating sometimes. Not sure why . I don't want this feature.
6. One major con I noticed is the wifi network updation . Most of the cameras now a days allow you to change wifi network via app . But for tapo we can't change wifi via app. I can see network selection is ready only field and no action on that.

It looked both too easy to be of use, and too complicated to actually set up and use. I couldn't have been more wrong. This TP-Link Tapo security camera is just what I needed. I bought one to try and see, and the minute it was set up and I could see what it could do, Immediately ordered three more. It is an easy setup task, and the benefits of having them are so much more than I would have expected. They are also more affordable than I expected. I now have one in each of my main rooms, and I can see what's happening in my house from the office desk. I have yet to try to access my house through the camera from another country, but I have no doubt that it would work. I use it to make sure my pets are OK. The camera pans, tilts, has night vision, records, has a privacy mode, can be wall mounted or free standing, and I can talk through the camera, which will be a weight off my mind when I have to go abroad and need to see if my pet sitter is actually doing what has been asked of them. If I can feel like this about my pets, I can imagine how a parent might feel to be able to watch their children through them! I recommend these cameras with no hesitation. Just FYI - there is an option to sign up for a monthly payable cloud storage system for these cameras. But if you are not keen to do that, you have to buy a storage card to record what you need. (There is an option to turn on the privacy mode which means the cameras will only record if the privacy mode is switched off.)

We were out of town for few days and this camera is suppose to monitor the house, but unfortunately it worked for only two days. WiFi was working fine other cameras from Philips was doing their job. But this Tapo camera went offline and did nothing for rest of the time. I have enabled the auto restart setting on daily intervals, but I believe that didn’t work. Tried to reach out customer care, but they will not respond, and since the product is working fine and issue is intermittent, was not able to show to the customer care. Think before you buy. Go with Philips cameras as they support offline recordings, though they are bit costly.,shreyas

Avec sa résolution 2K, la qualité d’image est impressionnante, offrant des vidéos nettes et claires, ce qui permet de capturer les moindres détails, même dans des conditions de faible luminosité. L’angle de vision de 360° et la possibilité de faire pivoter la caméra à distance via l’application Tapo ajoutent une flexibilité appréciable, permettant de couvrir une large zone avec un seul appareil.

L’installation est simple et rapide, même pour les moins technophiles. L’application Tapo est intuitive, rendant le contrôle de la caméra et l’accès aux vidéos enregistrées très faciles. De plus, la fonctionnalité de détection de mouvement et les notifications en temps réel sont très utiles pour rester informé de ce qui se passe chez soi.

Cependant, il y a quelques points à améliorer. Par exemple, la caméra nécessite une connexion Wi-Fi stable pour fonctionner de manière optimale, ce qui peut être un problème si le signal est faible. De plus, bien que la caméra soit livrée avec un emplacement pour carte microSD, le stockage en ligne est payant, ce qui peut représenter un coût supplémentaire à long terme.

En dépit de ces petits inconvénients, la Tapo 2K C210 reste un excellent rapport qualité-prix et je la recommande sans hésitation pour sécuriser votre domicile.

Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),5.0 out of 5 stars,Very handy,easy to clean and remove hardness and stains from the bath room floor,even I use it on the bathroom walls too.highly recommendable product,Aafiya

Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),3.0 out of 5 stars,The base is not stable by design. It swivels uncontrollably, and will fold over while scrubbing. So it is not possible to scrub without interruptions.

The materials are somewhat sturdy and won't break.

Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),1.0 out of 5 stars,This product could have been so much more. It has the brush, it has the stand, and it has the mobility. However, because you cannot keep it in a static position, it simply pivots whenever pressure it applied. Because of this "feature," you cannot clean anything with sufficient amounts of force.

The idea is good. But the execution is lacking. Avoid!,Sunny

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s been about 4 days since I got this product and I’m happy with it as a baby monitor so far. It was easy to set up. As it can rest on any flat surface, I didn’t need to install it anywhere but it comes with all the necessary accessories for a wall mount. But because of the flat design I can put it anywhere near my baby, and even if I move her to another room, I can take the camera with me. The 360° rotation is impressive and the video quality is great, especially since I use it on the phone mostly—even 480p is sufficient.

The best features are the sound and movement triggers. If my little one wakes up annd moves around and/or cries, notifications are sent to my phone and the feed is also recorded for that portion (in case you want to check what disturbed them). This is great if you need to be in another room—gives you peace of mind. In fact, the sound trigger feature is not available in other cameras in this price range so this was the main deciding factor for my choice. The live feed is definitely a boon to make sure baby is fine when you’re away from her. You can also zoom in on the live feed, which is a cool little feature that I was not expecting. Plus, with the recording feature, you get to have little memories of the baby waking up saved away for the future :)

The only feature I’ve not had a chance to test is night vision but some videos of this camera I saw on YouTube seem to show that this feature is solid in the camera.

Right now I’m on the Imou Life trial subscription because it’s free and will save all recordings to the cloud (up to 3 days). I’ll move to a micro SD soon though. Thinking of also getting a power bank to make it truly portable. Overall, this device is great value and I’d recommend it for parents looking for a baby monitor.

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,3.0 out of 5 stars,The camera is really good. I am using it since 2 years and the performance is still decent. It has decent night vision and quality. It rotates 360° horizontally and 270° vertically. You can use sd card or buy their subscription for storage which I will talk about later. But!!! The most annoying thingಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ!!! Is actually it's software (⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)(⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)!!! I should write this thing in app's review but I think it should be added in product review too as it shows your experience using the product. So the first and major problem is that the app logs out every 3-4 days you don't use it which is very annoying. Imagine there is an emergency at your home and you need to turn on the camera ASAP, you open the app and boom!! Throw your emergency away and login here(⁠◠⁠ω◕⁠)!!
Also trust me, it is veryyy like very complicated and hard to login. The other issue is bro why do you even sell you products in India if you don't want to accept India's payment options. You can't use UPI apps it tells you to use paypal, bro seriously how the hell am I supposed to use paypal here or else use international cards :D!! And don't just use international cards but you have to buy the monthly subscription and trust me again it is very hard to cancel the subscription. I only need the camera twice or thrice a year so why should I waste my money in buying the subscription every month!?!??
Well this is my review it ends here.

TNT THE NEXT TREND Ladder for Home use Heavy Duty Steel with Wide Steps and Top Platform with Anti Slip and Anti Skid Shoes can be Used as Step Stool in Office and Industrial Purpose (Black) (3 Step),1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this 2-step ladder with the expectation of it being sturdy, especially given the company’s claim that it can handle up to 150 kg. However, after just six months of light, home use by individuals weighing around 70-80 kg, one of the foot steps cracked, making it unsafe to use. This is disappointing for a product advertised as durable and capable of supporting much heavier weights. The quality feels subpar, and it’s clear the ladder isn’t built to withstand regular use.

Ozone Safe Locker for Home | Digital Lock | Safety Locker For Home | Non Motorized | Master & User PIN Code Access | Tijori Locker | Black | 16 Litres | 24 Months Warranty By Ozone (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,The secure locker arrived packaged in the branded box, cushioned on both sides with safety pads. However, the box lacked a proper seal, featuring only a simple cello tape adorned with the brand name. Setting up the safe proved to be straightforward, thanks to the provided instructions. It would have been beneficial if the instructions also covered setting the date and time, but I managed to navigate it by referring to their instructional YouTube video.

Upon opening the safe, I noticed it was disappointingly dirty. It's essential for the dispatch team to ensure cleanliness by removing paint, dust, and other debris before shipping the product. The carpet in the lower slot, while present, is inadequately glued and doesn't fit properly. Furthermore, the carpet piece's size does not match the dimensions, resulting in unsightly folds. The key is flimsy and seems generic, I am worried that any one with similar key can open the locker which totally defies the purpose of having the locker at first place.

The outer body of the safe is robust and well-constructed, seemingly made in India. However, my concern lies with the locking mechanism, which is made in China and appears flimsy. Only time will reveal the true durability of the safe. Additionally, the product seems slightly overpriced compared to competitors such as Amazon Basics safe lockers.

Despite these drawbacks, I recommend the product based on its overall performance and construction.

The carpet in the lower slot, while present, is inadequately glued and doesn't fit properly. Furthermore, the carpet piece's size does not match the dimensions, resulting in unsightly folds. The key is flimsy and seems generic, I am worried that any one with similar key can open the locker which totally defies the purpose of having the locker at first place.

The outer body of the safe is robust and well-constructed, seemingly made in India. However, my concern lies with the locking mechanism, which is made in China and appears flimsy. Only time will reveal the true durability of the safe. Additionally, the product seems slightly overpriced compared to competitors such as Amazon Basics safe lockers.

Despite these drawbacks, I recommend the product based on its overall performance and construction.

Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL (Modular,1 Piece),5.0 out of 5 stars,Firstly, the modular design of this broom is very convenient. It comes in 1 piece, making it easy to assemble and use. The handle is also adjustable, which is perfect for someone like me who is on the shorter side. I can adjust the handle to my desired length for comfortable sweeping. One of the main features that drew me to this broom was the promise of no dust. I have always struggled with traditional brooms leaving behind a trail of dust and debris. However, the Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL lives up to its name. The bristles are made of soft, fine fibers that effectively pick up all the dust and dirt without scattering it around. This has made sweeping a much cleaner and less messy task. Another great feature of this broom is its XL size. The broom head is wider than most traditional brooms, which means I can cover more surface area with each sweep. This has significantly reduced my cleaning time. The broom is also lightweight, making it easy to maneuver around furniture and corners. The quality of this broom is top-notch. The bristles are strong and durable, and they have not shown any signs of wear and tear even after multiple uses. The handle is also sturdy and feels comfortable to hold.,One Malabar Hill

Scotch-Brite Plastic Spin Mop Head and Handle (Suitable for Scotch-Brite 2 in 1 Spin Mop Only),3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this mop from Scotch Brite because I was frustrated with the Prestige ones, many of which now seem to be fake copies. Although this one is a bit pricey, it’s been working well after several months of use.

Pros:
1) The spin mechanism is effective; it dries quickly after just two spins.
2) The mopping material is decent and gets the job done, although it mops in patches due to the design.
3) It’s very easy to assemble.
4) You can buy just the mop stick alone if you already have a mop tub.

Cons:
1) The mop’s thread material is quite delicate. After the first wash, at least three strands came out, and a few more falls off with each use. And will continue for sure, I know.

Overall, I’m still using it. It’s average but functional for daily use.

Rushwak Bathroom Cleaning Brush with Wiper Upgraded 3 in 1 Toilet Brush Bathroom Brush with Long Handle 180° Rotate Bathroom Floor Cleaning Brush Bathroom Cleaning Accessories (Multicolor),5.0 out of 5 stars,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I recently purchased the bathroom cleaning brush with a wiper, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way possible! This product is a game-changer when it comes to keeping my bathroom spotless and gleaming.

First and foremost, the quality of this brush is outstanding. The bristles are sturdy and durable, ensuring they don't wear out quickly even with regular use. The handle is comfortable to grip, and the overall construction feels solid and well-made. I can tell that this brush is built to last, which makes it a fantastic investment for my cleaning arsenal.

The wiper feature is what truly sets this bathroom brush apart from others on the market. It's incredibly handy for wiping away excess water and cleaning solution, leaving my bathroom surfaces completely dry and streak-free. This saves me a lot of time and effort, as I don't have to reach for a separate cloth or paper towel to wipe down surfaces after scrubbing.

Cleaning with this brush is a breeze. The bristles do an excellent job of tackling tough stains and grime without scratching or damaging my bathroom fixtures. Plus, the wiper efficiently collects the residue, making the whole process more efficient and thorough.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with the bathroom cleaning brush with a wiper. Its impressive quality, efficient cleaning power, and convenient design have made my cleaning routine much more enjoyable. If you're looking for a top-notch bathroom cleaning tool, I highly recommend giving this brush a try. You won't be disappointed!

The video quality is too good and the setup is very easy. But the product needs lot of improvements which I am listing out below.
1. The tilt option is not that great and you can't focus the floor and door at the same time if it is installed above 5 feet high.
2. The 2 way talk option is just for name sake. The speaker quality is one of the worst one could imagine. You literally need to keep your ears in the camera to hear what the other one speaks.
3. Sound notifications and motion notifications are annoying which made me to disable them. Sound of crows and dogs far from home are detected (which happens all the time) and sends notifications. Similarly screen movements are sent as motion detection notifications. Detection of Human voice and motion alone could have been helpful and solved the real need.
4. Onvif never works. It asks for Password reset but if I select that nothing happens but freezing.
5. Smart controls seems not working. I have scheduled things for eg. Switch on the recording when it is 8am. But it never started to record.
6. Also there is no option to automate recording like Stop recording from Night 8 to Morning 8 every day.
7. Option to view in PC is too naive. If I wanted to view the feeds from office (or other phone restricted place), I can't do that as I need to scan the QR shown by the webpage through the mobile app. Even then it hardly works/opens.

Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reasonable pricing and of the correct size for cleaning purposes. Easy to use and very practical.,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a reliable and effective cleaning solution that effortlessly balances form and function. With a sturdy build and thoughtful design, these sponges prove to be a versatile companion in tackling various cleaning tasks around the house.

The pack's inclusion of six sponges ensures an extended period of use, making it a cost-effective option for those who require a long-lasting cleaning tool. The dual-sided design, featuring a scrubbing side and a softer wiping side, offers the flexibility needed to address both stubborn stains and delicate surfaces. This adaptability proves especially handy in the kitchen, where grime and grease are common adversaries.

One of the standout features of these sponges is their durability. The scrubbing side effectively removes tough residue without wearing down too quickly, while the wiping side maintains its integrity through multiple uses. This robustness translates into fewer replacements and less waste, contributing to a more sustainable cleaning routine.

While the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge pack delivers on its promises, there is room for slight improvement. The scrubbing surface, while effective, may feel abrasive on more delicate items. Additionally, a greater variety of colors or patterns could add a touch of visual appeal to the utilitarian design.

In conclusion, the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a dependable and practical cleaning tool that shines in its ability to adapt to different cleaning challenges. Its longevity, dual-sided functionality, and overall durability make it a solid investment for anyone seeking a reliable cleaning companion.

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this product in May-2024, total 3 nos for my different bathroom showers. After almost 3 months of usage. I'm forced to post this review. So everything was fine till date. Even the filter was doing a good job. The problem comes when u want to replace the cartridge or u want to change the position of the cartridge. So 1st time I changed the direction of cartridge from the filter upside down. This is required to be done as per the company's instruction. It took hell lot of ime to do this job..I don't know why they have made this filter and cartridge assembly in such a bad design that u cannot remove the cartridge from the filter. I did this anyhow and second time I tried this today with another filter but the cartridge is not getting separated whatever I tried. If the manufacturer wanted to sell cartridge as a replacement or consumable item then it should have been user friendly. Even entire cartridge got damaged but it didn't come out. I am had Even purchased extra cartridge for this filter..it's a waste for me now..I don't know any other person faced the same problems but this is the worst design i must say. Again the filter is expensive around 2k..u cannot waste this much money for 3-4 months usage.i would request water science team to see this and help me out,Pranav Kankee

Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product to use for once and all. It is for day to day normal use and for normal stain utensils. Thank you.,S.S.
Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),4.0 out of 5 stars,Have always been purchasing the original scotch brite pads since they don't leave behind residue on the plates which we then inevitably digest while eating off plates. Because, let's face it, how much ever we wash the plates, there is always micro-residue from the cheap ripped off scrub pads in the market. The Scotch Brite scrub pads don't degrade like their cheap counterparts and hence last longer.

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this bottle cleaner. This is the second one I have ordered. I have kept one each at my home and my in law's place. It does the job. It does reach the bottom corners of the bottles as claimed. Overall a good one. I use it mostly for the kids bottles. It has a good reach. It dries quickly once you shake off as much water as you can.
The sponge is detachable from the handle as mentioned in the product description, to enable it to be changed once the sponge weras out. Now I haven't checked if the sponge head is available separately. Otherwise this is a bit expensive.,Mom to an autistic kid.
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,The scrubber given is very good and it cleans the milk residue properly , the only issue is that the handle detaches and the scrubber stays the bottle which is very hard to remove,Udayani
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),3.0 out of 5 stars,Suitable for bottles with slightly bigger mouths; though not meant for heavy use, if head gets stuck inside any bottle, its sponge part can come off the handle!,Ajay
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely wonderful product. Exactly what i needed. Perfect cleaning.

Another review mentioned, the scrub coming off if bottle mouth is small... it is a hassle but not a hig one. Having a removable facility ensures that the scrub can be cleaned throughly. So, it is good feature.,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),1.0 out of 5 stars,3rd class quality. Unable to clean the bottles easily. Foam and handle got seperated during cleaning making the cleaning uncomfortable and ineffective. Worst brush,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this bottle cleaner for cleaning steel water bottle. I was facing issue with local brushes where the sponge on the lower part of the brush would get off quickly creating issues in cleaning the bottom of the bottle from inside. Did purchase this product with the hopes that it would solve this issue and the product delivered true to my expectations.

The only downside I see is that if the mouth of the bottle is a bit smaller, there can be issues in getting the brush outside without the risk of cleaning brush stuck inside the bottle.,Shantanu
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,Getting the perfect bottle cleaning brush is a hard task for Mommies. This one does the job well but as the scrubber is loosely attached to the handle..it often comes out while pulling away from smaller bottles.

I suggest Team Scotch Brite to make a smaller one of this for kids feeding bottles.,Aprajita Mishra

The sponge is detachable from the handle as mentioned in the product description, to enable it to be changed once the sponge weras out. Now I haven't checked if the sponge head is available separately. Otherwise this is a bit expensive.,Mom to an autistic kid.
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,The scrubber given is very good and it cleans the milk residue properly , the only issue is that the handle detaches and the scrubber stays the bottle which is very hard to remove,Udayani
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),3.0 out of 5 stars,Suitable for bottles with slightly bigger mouths; though not meant for heavy use, if head gets stuck inside any bottle, its sponge part can come off the handle!,Ajay
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely wonderful product. Exactly what i needed. Perfect cleaning.

Another review mentioned, the scrub coming off if bottle mouth is small... it is a hassle but not a hig one. Having a removable facility ensures that the scrub can be cleaned throughly. So, it is good feature.,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),1.0 out of 5 stars,3rd class quality. Unable to clean the bottles easily. Foam and handle got seperated during cleaning making the cleaning uncomfortable and ineffective. Worst brush,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this bottle cleaner for cleaning steel water bottle. I was facing issue with local brushes where the sponge on the lower part of the brush would get off quickly creating issues in cleaning the bottom of the bottle from inside. Did purchase this product with the hopes that it would solve this issue and the product delivered true to my expectations.

The only downside I see is that if the mouth of the bottle is a bit smaller, there can be issues in getting the brush outside without the risk of cleaning brush stuck inside the bottle.,Shantanu
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,Getting the perfect bottle cleaning brush is a hard task for Mommies. This one does the job well but as the scrubber is loosely attached to the handle..it often comes out while pulling away from smaller bottles.

I suggest Team Scotch Brite to make a smaller one of this for kids feeding bottles.,Aprajita Mishra
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Giving review after using it for a year..very good quality..still going.must buy,Akash Singh
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure how long this will last but it is stronger than the usual "bottle brush" as it is made from foam rasher than "brush material"

Works well - just a pity I had to buy two!!!,Peter D. G. Raven

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,4.0 out of 5 stars,Updating my review after one month of use. No change in my rating and just updating more prons and cons

Pros
1. Good indoor camera for normal use.
2. Configuring is easy
3.Tapo app is responsive and working good
4. Video Clarity is ok
5. Sound is ok
6. Rotation is smooth , but a very small sound while rotating. A person who is standing near to camera can notice this sound
7. Zooming is ok , but no optical zoom
8. Night vision is good
9. You can add presets and presets are working good. I am specifically telling this because presets won't work well in some other brand cameraz . But for tapo it is working very good.

10. You can adjust rotation angle and it is one of the feature missing in other camera.

11. Person detection is working well and you can easily differtiate normal motion detection with person detection by a person symbol on thumbnails.

Cons
1. Cloud storage is expensive
2. No optical zoom, only digital zoom. I didn't like zoom clarity compared to other 3mp models. If you want to zoom a large distance , don't take this.i own an ezviz 1k camera and i liked zoom clarity of that than this.
3. Can't control the siren as per our will.siren works only in motion detection. So if a small insect is flying , then it will make sound. But we can restrict it to human detection. I always prefer an alarm with a button which we can trigger from app.
4. Play back or recorded video in memory card fast-forward option is not via slider. You can select a speed and it will fast forward based on that. But I always prefer a slider for fast-forward.

5. Tapo is autorotating sometimes. Not sure why . I don't want this feature.
6. One major con I noticed is the wifi network updation . Most of the cameras now a days allow you to change wifi network via app . But for tapo we can't change wifi via app. I can see network selection is ready only field and no action on that.

It looked both too easy to be of use, and too complicated to actually set up and use. I couldn't have been more wrong. This TP-Link Tapo security camera is just what I needed. I bought one to try and see, and the minute it was set up and I could see what it could do, Immediately ordered three more. It is an easy setup task, and the benefits of having them are so much more than I would have expected. They are also more affordable than I expected. I now have one in each of my main rooms, and I can see what's happening in my house from the office desk. I have yet to try to access my house through the camera from another country, but I have no doubt that it would work. I use it to make sure my pets are OK. The camera pans, tilts, has night vision, records, has a privacy mode, can be wall mounted or free standing, and I can talk through the camera, which will be a weight off my mind when I have to go abroad and need to see if my pet sitter is actually doing what has been asked of them. If I can feel like this about my pets, I can imagine how a parent might feel to be able to watch their children through them! I recommend these cameras with no hesitation. Just FYI - there is an option to sign up for a monthly payable cloud storage system for these cameras. But if you are not keen to do that, you have to buy a storage card to record what you need. (There is an option to turn on the privacy mode which means the cameras will only record if the privacy mode is switched off.)

We were out of town for few days and this camera is suppose to monitor the house, but unfortunately it worked for only two days. WiFi was working fine other cameras from Philips was doing their job. But this Tapo camera went offline and did nothing for rest of the time. I have enabled the auto restart setting on daily intervals, but I believe that didn’t work. Tried to reach out customer care, but they will not respond, and since the product is working fine and issue is intermittent, was not able to show to the customer care. Think before you buy.

Avec sa résolution 2K, la qualité d’image est impressionnante, offrant des vidéos nettes et claires, ce qui permet de capturer les moindres détails, même dans des conditions de faible luminosité. L’angle de vision de 360° et la possibilité de faire pivoter la caméra à distance via l’application Tapo ajoutent une flexibilité appréciable, permettant de couvrir une large zone avec un seul appareil.

L’installation est simple et rapide, même pour les moins technophiles. L’application Tapo est intuitive, rendant le contrôle de la caméra et l’accès aux vidéos enregistrées très faciles. De plus, la fonctionnalité de détection de mouvement et les notifications en temps réel sont très utiles pour rester informé de ce qui se passe chez soi.

Cependant, il y a quelques points à améliorer. Par exemple, la caméra nécessite une connexion Wi-Fi stable pour fonctionner de manière optimale, ce qui peut être un problème si le signal est faible. De plus, bien que la caméra soit livrée avec un emplacement pour carte microSD, le stockage en ligne est payant, ce qui peut représenter un coût supplémentaire à long terme.

En dépit de ces petits inconvénients, la Tapo 2K C210 reste un excellent rapport qualité-prix et je la recommande sans hésitation pour sécuriser votre domicile.

Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),5.0 out of 5 stars,Very handy,easy to clean and remove hardness and stains from the bath room floor,even I use it on the bathroom walls too.highly recommendable product,Aafiya

Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),3.0 out of 5 stars,The base is not stable by design. It swivels uncontrollably, and will fold over while scrubbing. So it is not possible to scrub without interruptions.

The materials are somewhat sturdy and won't break.

So 3 stars for that. 2 stars less for usability.,ReviewerX
Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),5.0 out of 5 stars,It is very good to clean the tiled wall of bathroom/toilet. limited utility but excellent for the mentioned purpose.,Dhiman S.
Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),1.0 out of 5 stars,This product could have been so much more. It has the brush, it has the stand, and it has the mobility. However, because you cannot keep it in a static position, it simply pivots whenever pressure it applied. Because of this "feature," you cannot clean anything with sufficient amounts of force.

The idea is good. But the execution is lacking. Avoid!,Sunny

Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),3.0 out of 5 stars,The base is not stable by design. It swivels uncontrollably, and will fold over while scrubbing. So it is not possible to scrub without interruptions.

The materials are somewhat sturdy and won't break.

So 3 stars for that. 2 stars less for usability.,ReviewerX

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s been about 4 days since I got this product and I’m happy with it as a baby monitor so far. It was easy to set up. As it can rest on any flat surface, I didn’t need to install it anywhere but it comes with all the necessary accessories for a wall mount. But because of the flat design I can put it anywhere near my baby, and even if I move her to another room, I can take the camera with me. The 360° rotation is impressive and the video quality is great, especially since I use it on the phone mostly—even 480p is sufficient.

The best features are the sound and movement triggers. If my little one wakes up annd moves around and/or cries, notifications are sent to my phone and the feed is also recorded for that portion (in case you want to check what disturbed them). This is great if you need to be in another room—gives you peace of mind. In fact, the sound trigger feature is not available in other cameras in this price range so this was the main deciding factor for my choice. The live feed is definitely a boon to make sure baby is fine when you’re away from her. You can also zoom in on the live feed, which is a cool little feature that I was not expecting. Plus, with the recording feature, you get to have little memories of the baby waking up saved away for the future :)

The only feature I’ve not had a chance to test is night vision but some videos of this camera I saw on YouTube seem to show that this feature is solid in the camera.

Right now I’m on the Imou Life trial subscription because it’s free and will save all recordings to the cloud (up to 3 days). I’ll move to a micro SD soon though. Thinking of also getting a power bank to make it truly portable. Overall, this device is great value and I’d recommend it for parents looking for a baby monitor.

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,3.0 out of 5 stars,The camera is really good. I am using it since 2 years and the performance is still decent. It has decent night vision and quality. It rotates 360° horizontally and 270° vertically. You can use sd card or buy their subscription for storage which I will talk about later. But!!! The most annoying thingಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ!!! Is actually it's software (⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)(⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)!!! I should write this thing in app's review but I think it should be added in product review too as it shows your experience using the product. So the first and major problem is that the app logs out every 3-4 days you don't use it which is very annoying. Imagine there is an emergency at your home and you need to turn on the camera ASAP, you open the app and boom!! Throw your emergency away and login here(⁠◠⁠ω◕⁠)!!
Also trust me, it is veryyy like very complicated and hard to login. The other issue is bro why do you even sell you products in India if you don't want to accept India's payment options. You can't use UPI apps it tells you to use paypal, bro seriously how the hell am I supposed to use paypal here or else use international cards :D!! And don't just use international cards but you have to buy the monthly subscription and trust me again it is very hard to cancel the subscription. I only need the camera twice or thrice a year so why should I waste my money in buying the subscription every month!?!??
Well this is my review it ends here.

TNT THE NEXT TREND Ladder for Home use Heavy Duty Steel with Wide Steps and Top Platform with Anti Slip and Anti Skid Shoes can be Used as Step Stool in Office and Industrial Purpose (Black) (3 Step),1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this 2-step ladder with the expectation of it being sturdy, especially given the company’s claim that it can handle up to 150 kg. However, after just six months of light, home use by individuals weighing around 70-80 kg, one of the foot steps cracked, making it unsafe to use. This is disappointing for a product advertised as durable and capable of supporting much heavier weights. The quality feels subpar, and it’s clear the ladder isn’t built to withstand regular use. I wouldn’t recommend this product if you're looking for something reliable and long-lasting.,mani

Ozone Safe Locker for Home | Digital Lock | Safety Locker For Home | Non Motorized | Master & User PIN Code Access | Tijori Locker | Black | 16 Litres | 24 Months Warranty By Ozone (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,The secure locker arrived packaged in the branded box, cushioned on both sides with safety pads. However, the box lacked a proper seal, featuring only a simple cello tape adorned with the brand name. Setting up the safe proved to be straightforward, thanks to the provided instructions. It would have been beneficial if the instructions also covered setting the date and time, but I managed to navigate it by referring to their instructional YouTube video.

Upon opening the safe, I noticed it was disappointingly dirty. It's essential for the dispatch team to ensure cleanliness by removing paint, dust, and other debris before shipping the product. The carpet in the lower slot, while present, is inadequately glued and doesn't fit properly. Furthermore, the carpet piece's size does not match the dimensions, resulting in unsightly folds. The key is flimsy and seems generic, I am worried that any one with similar key can open the locker which totally defies the purpose of having the locker at first place.

The outer body of the safe is robust and well-constructed, seemingly made in India. However, my concern lies with the locking mechanism, which is made in China and appears flimsy. Only time will reveal the true durability of the safe. Additionally, the product seems slightly overpriced compared to competitors such as Amazon Basics safe lockers.

Despite these drawbacks, I recommend the product based on its overall performance and construction.

Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL (Modular,1 Piece),5.0 out of 5 stars,Firstly, the modular design of this broom is very convenient. It comes in 1 piece, making it easy to assemble and use. The handle is also adjustable, which is perfect for someone like me who is on the shorter side. I can adjust the handle to my desired length for comfortable sweeping. One of the main features that drew me to this broom was the promise of no dust. I have always struggled with traditional brooms leaving behind a trail of dust and debris. However, the Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL lives up to its name. The bristles are made of soft, fine fibers that effectively pick up all the dust and dirt without scattering it around. This has made sweeping a much cleaner and less messy task. Another great feature of this broom is its XL size. The broom head is wider than most traditional brooms, which means I can cover more surface area with each sweep. This has significantly reduced my cleaning time. The broom is also lightweight, making it easy to maneuver around furniture and corners. The quality of this broom is top-notch. The bristles are strong and durable, and they have not shown any signs of wear and tear even after multiple uses. The handle is also sturdy and feels comfortable to hold.,One Malabar Hill

Scotch-Brite Plastic Spin Mop Head and Handle (Suitable for Scotch-Brite 2 in 1 Spin Mop Only),3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this mop from Scotch Brite because I was frustrated with the Prestige ones, many of which now seem to be fake copies. Although this one is a bit pricey, it’s been working well after several months of use.

Pros:
1) The spin mechanism is effective; it dries quickly after just two spins.
2) The mopping material is decent and gets the job done, although it mops in patches due to the design.
3) It’s very easy to assemble.
4) You can buy just the mop stick alone if you already have a mop tub.

Cons:
1) The mop’s thread material is quite delicate. After the first wash, at least three strands came out, and a few more falls off with each use. And will continue for sure, I know.

Overall, I’m still using it. It’s average but functional for daily use.

Rushwak Bathroom Cleaning Brush with Wiper Upgraded 3 in 1 Toilet Brush Bathroom Brush with Long Handle 180° Rotate Bathroom Floor Cleaning Brush Bathroom Cleaning Accessories (Multicolor),5.0 out of 5 stars,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I recently purchased the bathroom cleaning brush with a wiper, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way possible! This product is a game-changer when it comes to keeping my bathroom spotless and gleaming.

First and foremost, the quality of this brush is outstanding. The bristles are sturdy and durable, ensuring they don't wear out quickly even with regular use. The handle is comfortable to grip, and the overall construction feels solid and well-made. I can tell that this brush is built to last, which makes it a fantastic investment for my cleaning arsenal.

The wiper feature is what truly sets this bathroom brush apart from others on the market. It's incredibly handy for wiping away excess water and cleaning solution, leaving my bathroom surfaces completely dry and streak-free. This saves me a lot of time and effort, as I don't have to reach for a separate cloth or paper towel to wipe down surfaces after scrubbing.

Cleaning with this brush is a breeze. The bristles do an excellent job of tackling tough stains and grime without scratching or damaging my bathroom fixtures. Plus, the wiper efficiently collects the residue, making the whole process more efficient and thorough.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with the bathroom cleaning brush with a wiper. Its impressive quality, efficient cleaning power, and convenient design have made my cleaning routine much more enjoyable. If you're looking for a top-notch bathroom cleaning tool, I highly recommend giving this brush a try. You won't be disappointed!

The video quality is too good and the setup is very easy. But the product needs lot of improvements which I am listing out below.
1. The tilt option is not that great and you can't focus the floor and door at the same time if it is installed above 5 feet high.
2. The 2 way talk option is just for name sake. The speaker quality is one of the worst one could imagine. You literally need to keep your ears in the camera to hear what the other one speaks.
3. Sound notifications and motion notifications are annoying which made me to disable them. Sound of crows and dogs far from home are detected (which happens all the time) and sends notifications. Similarly screen movements are sent as motion detection notifications. Detection of Human voice and motion alone could have been helpful and solved the real need.
4. Onvif never works. It asks for Password reset but if I select that nothing happens but freezing.
5. Smart controls seems not working. I have scheduled things for eg. Switch on the recording when it is 8am. But it never started to record.
6. Also there is no option to automate recording like Stop recording from Night 8 to Morning 8 every day.
7. Option to view in PC is too naive. If I wanted to view the feeds from office (or other phone restricted place), I can't do that as I need to scan the QR shown by the webpage through the mobile app. Even then it hardly works/opens.

Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reasonable pricing and of the correct size for cleaning purposes. Easy to use and very practical.,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a reliable and effective cleaning solution that effortlessly balances form and function. With a sturdy build and thoughtful design, these sponges prove to be a versatile companion in tackling various cleaning tasks around the house.

The pack's inclusion of six sponges ensures an extended period of use, making it a cost-effective option for those who require a long-lasting cleaning tool. The dual-sided design, featuring a scrubbing side and a softer wiping side, offers the flexibility needed to address both stubborn stains and delicate surfaces. This adaptability proves especially handy in the kitchen, where grime and grease are common adversaries.

One of the standout features of these sponges is their durability. The scrubbing side effectively removes tough residue without wearing down too quickly, while the wiping side maintains its integrity through multiple uses. This robustness translates into fewer replacements and less waste, contributing to a more sustainable cleaning routine.

While the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge pack delivers on its promises, there is room for slight improvement. The scrubbing surface, while effective, may feel abrasive on more delicate items. Additionally, a greater variety of colors or patterns could add a touch of visual appeal to the utilitarian design.

In conclusion, the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a dependable and practical cleaning tool that shines in its ability to adapt to different cleaning challenges. Its longevity, dual-sided functionality, and overall durability make it a solid investment for anyone seeking a reliable cleaning companion. While some refinements could enhance its aesthetic appeal, its performance remains the true highlight. Say goodbye to stubborn stains and embrace the convenience of these scrub sponges in your cleaning arsenal.

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this product in May-2024, total 3 nos for my different bathroom showers. After almost 3 months of usage. I'm forced to post this review. So everything was fine till date. Even the filter was doing a good job. The problem comes when u want to replace the cartridge or u want to change the position of the cartridge. So 1st time I changed the direction of cartridge from the filter upside down. This is required to be done as per the company's instruction. It took hell lot of ime to do this job..I don't know why they have made this filter and cartridge assembly in such a bad design that u cannot remove the cartridge from the filter. I did this anyhow and second time I tried this today with another filter but the cartridge is not getting separated whatever I tried. If the manufacturer wanted to sell cartridge as a replacement or consumable item then it should have been user friendly. Even entire cartridge got damaged but it didn't come out. I am had Even purchased extra cartridge for this filter..it's a waste for me now..I don't know any other person faced the same problems but this is the worst design i must say. Again the filter is expensive around 2k..u cannot waste this much money for 3-4 months usage.i would request water science team to see this and help me out,Pranav Kankee

Such useless products seems they are more reliant on paid reviews otherwise there is no explanation to generally good reviews when both the products i recieved were faulty,av123456

Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product to use for once and all. It is for day to day normal use and for normal stain utensils. Thank you.,S.S.
Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),4.0 out of 5 stars,Have always been purchasing the original scotch brite pads since they don't leave behind residue on the plates which we then inevitably digest while eating off plates. Because, let's face it, how much ever we wash the plates, there is always micro-residue from the cheap ripped off scrub pads in the market. The Scotch Brite scrub pads don't degrade like their cheap counterparts and hence last longer.

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this bottle cleaner. This is the second one I have ordered. I have kept one each at my home and my in law's place. It does the job. It does reach the bottom corners of the bottles as claimed. Overall a good one. I use it mostly for the kids bottles. It has a good reach. It dries quickly once you shake off as much water as you can.
The sponge is detachable from the handle as mentioned in the product description, to enable it to be changed once the sponge weras out. Now I haven't checked if the sponge head is available separately. Otherwise this is a bit expensive.,Mom to an autistic kid.
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,The scrubber given is very good and it cleans the milk residue properly , the only issue is that the handle detaches and the scrubber stays the bottle which is very hard to remove,Udayani

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this bottle cleaner for cleaning steel water bottle. I was facing issue with local brushes where the sponge on the lower part of the brush would get off quickly creating issues in cleaning the bottom of the bottle from inside. Did purchase this product with the hopes that it would solve this issue and the product delivered true to my expectations.

The only downside I see is that if the mouth of the bottle is a bit smaller, there can be issues in getting the brush outside without the risk of cleaning brush stuck inside the bottle.,Shantanu
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,Getting the perfect bottle cleaning brush is a hard task for Mommies.

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,4.0 out of 5 stars,Updating my review after one month of use. No change in my rating and just updating more prons and cons

Pros
1. Good indoor camera for normal use.
2. Configuring is easy
3.Tapo app is responsive and working good
4. Video Clarity is ok
5. Sound is ok
6. Rotation is smooth , but a very small sound while rotating. A person who is standing near to camera can notice this sound
7. Zooming is ok , but no optical zoom
8. Night vision is good
9. You can add presets and presets are working good. I am specifically telling this because presets won't work well in some other brand cameraz . But for tapo it is working very good.

10. You can adjust rotation angle and it is one of the feature missing in other camera.

11. Person detection is working well and you can easily differtiate normal motion detection with person detection by a person symbol on thumbnails.

Cons
1. Cloud storage is expensive
2. No optical zoom, only digital zoom. I didn't like zoom clarity compared to other 3mp models. If you want to zoom a large distance , don't take this.i own an ezviz 1k camera and i liked zoom clarity of that than this.
3. Can't control the siren as per our will.siren works only in motion detection. So if a small insect is flying , then it will make sound. But we can restrict it to human detection. I always prefer an alarm with a button which we can trigger from app.
4. Play back or recorded video in memory card fast-forward option is not via slider. You can select a speed and it will fast forward based on that. But I always prefer a slider for fast-forward.

5. Tapo is autorotating sometimes. Not sure why . I don't want this feature.
6. One major con I noticed is the wifi network updation . Most of the cameras now a days allow you to change wifi network via app . But for tapo we can't change wifi via app. I can see network selection is ready only field and no action on that.

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was skeptical when this camera was recommended to me. It looked both too easy to be of use, and too complicated to actually set up and use. I couldn't have been more wrong. This TP-Link Tapo security camera is just what I needed. I bought one to try and see, and the minute it was set up and I could see what it could do, Immediately ordered three more. It is an easy setup task, and the benefits of having them are so much more than I would have expected. They are also more affordable than I expected. I now have one in each of my main rooms, and I can see what's happening in my house from the office desk. I have yet to try to access my house through the camera from another country, but I have no doubt that it would work. I use it to make sure my pets are OK. The camera pans, tilts, has night vision, records, has a privacy mode, can be wall mounted or free standing, and I can talk through the camera, which will be a weight off my mind when I have to go abroad and need to see if my pet sitter is actually doing what has been asked of them. If I can feel like this about my pets, I can imagine how a parent might feel to be able to watch their children through them! I recommend these cameras with no hesitation. Just FYI - there is an option to sign up for a monthly payable cloud storage system for these cameras. But if you are not keen to do that, you have to buy a storage card to record what you need. (There is an option to turn on the privacy mode which means the cameras will only record if the privacy mode is switched off.)

Avec sa résolution 2K, la qualité d’image est impressionnante, offrant des vidéos nettes et claires, ce qui permet de capturer les moindres détails, même dans des conditions de faible luminosité. L’angle de vision de 360° et la possibilité de faire pivoter la caméra à distance via l’application Tapo ajoutent une flexibilité appréciable, permettant de couvrir une large zone avec un seul appareil.

L’installation est simple et rapide, même pour les moins technophiles. L’application Tapo est intuitive, rendant le contrôle de la caméra et l’accès aux vidéos enregistrées très faciles. De plus, la fonctionnalité de détection de mouvement et les notifications en temps réel sont très utiles pour rester informé de ce qui se passe chez soi.

Cependant, il y a quelques points à améliorer. Par exemple, la caméra nécessite une connexion Wi-Fi stable pour fonctionner de manière optimale, ce qui peut être un problème si le signal est faible. De plus, bien que la caméra soit livrée avec un emplacement pour carte microSD, le stockage en ligne est payant, ce qui peut représenter un coût supplémentaire à long terme.

En dépit de ces petits inconvénients, la Tapo 2K C210 reste un excellent rapport qualité-prix et je la recommande sans hésitation pour sécuriser votre domicile.

Pros
1. Good indoor camera for normal use.
2. Configuring is easy
3.Tapo app is responsive and working good
4. Video Clarity is ok
5. Sound is ok
6. Rotation is smooth , but a very small sound while rotating. A person who is standing near to camera can notice this sound
7. Zooming is ok , but no optical zoom
8. Night vision is good
9. You can add presets and presets are working good. I am specifically telling this because presets won't work well in some other brand cameraz . But for tapo it is working very good.

10. You can adjust rotation angle and it is one of the feature missing in other camera.

11. Person detection is working well and you can easily differtiate normal motion detection with person detection by a person symbol on thumbnails.

Cons
1. Cloud storage is expensive

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s been about 4 days since I got this product and I’m happy with it as a baby monitor so far. It was easy to set up. As it can rest on any flat surface, I didn’t need to install it anywhere but it comes with all the necessary accessories for a wall mount. But because of the flat design I can put it anywhere near my baby, and even if I move her to another room, I can take the camera with me. The 360° rotation is impressive and the video quality is great, especially since I use it on the phone mostly—even 480p is sufficient.

The best features are the sound and movement triggers. If my little one wakes up annd moves around and/or cries, notifications are sent to my phone and the feed is also recorded for that portion (in case you want to check what disturbed them). This is great if you need to be in another room—gives you peace of mind. In fact, the sound trigger feature is not available in other cameras in this price range so this was the main deciding factor for my choice. The live feed is definitely a boon to make sure baby is fine when you’re away from her. You can also zoom in on the live feed, which is a cool little feature that I was not expecting. Plus, with the recording feature, you get to have little memories of the baby waking up saved away for the future :)

The only feature I’ve not had a chance to test is night vision but some videos of this camera I saw on YouTube seem to show that this feature is solid in the camera.

Right now I’m on the Imou Life trial subscription because it’s free and will save all recordings to the cloud (up to 3 days). I’ll move to a micro SD soon though. Thinking of also getting a power bank to make it truly portable. Overall, this device is great value and I’d recommend it for parents looking for a baby monitor.

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,3.0 out of 5 stars,The camera is really good. I am using it since 2 years and the performance is still decent. It has decent night vision and quality. It rotates 360° horizontally and 270° vertically. You can use sd card or buy their subscription for storage which I will talk about later. But!!! The most annoying thingಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ!!! Is actually it's software (⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)(⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)!!! I should write this thing in app's review but I think it should be added in product review too as it shows your experience using the product. So the first and major problem is that the app logs out every 3-4 days you don't use it which is very annoying. Imagine there is an emergency at your home and you need to turn on the camera ASAP, you open the app and boom!! Throw your emergency away and login here(⁠◠⁠ω◕⁠)!!
Also trust me, it is veryyy like very complicated and hard to login. The other issue is bro why do you even sell you products in India if you don't want to accept India's payment options. You can't use UPI apps it tells you to use paypal, bro seriously how the hell am I supposed to use paypal here or else use international cards :D!! And don't just use international cards but you have to buy the monthly subscription and trust me again it is very hard to cancel the subscription. I only need the camera twice or thrice a year so why should I waste my money in buying the subscription every month!?!??
Well this is my review it ends here.

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s been about 4 days since I got this product and I’m happy with it as a baby monitor so far. It was easy to set up. As it can rest on any flat surface, I didn’t need to install it anywhere but it comes with all the necessary accessories for a wall mount. But because of the flat design I can put it anywhere near my baby, and even if I move her to another room, I can take the camera with me. The 360° rotation is impressive and the video quality is great, especially since I use it on the phone mostly—even 480p is sufficient.

The best features are the sound and movement triggers. If my little one wakes up annd moves around and/or cries, notifications are sent to my phone and the feed is also recorded for that portion (in case you want to check what disturbed them). This is great if you need to be in another room—gives you peace of mind. In fact, the sound trigger feature is not available in other cameras in this price range so this was the main deciding factor for my choice. The live feed is definitely a boon to make sure baby is fine when you’re away from her. You can also zoom in on the live feed, which is a cool little feature that I was not expecting. Plus, with the recording feature, you get to have little memories of the baby waking up saved away for the future :)

The only feature I’ve not had a chance to test is night vision but some videos of this camera I saw on YouTube seem to show that this feature is solid in the camera.

Right now I’m on the Imou Life trial subscription because it’s free and will save all recordings to the cloud (up to 3 days). I’ll move to a micro SD soon though. Thinking of also getting a power bank to make it truly portable. Overall, this device is great value and I’d recommend it for parents looking for a baby monitor.

TNT THE NEXT TREND Ladder for Home use Heavy Duty Steel with Wide Steps and Top Platform with Anti Slip and Anti Skid Shoes can be Used as Step Stool in Office and Industrial Purpose (Black) (3 Step),1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this 2-step ladder with the expectation of it being sturdy, especially given the company’s claim that it can handle up to 150 kg. However, after just six months of light, home use by individuals weighing around 70-80 kg, one of the foot steps cracked, making it unsafe to use. This is disappointing for a product advertised as durable and capable of supporting much heavier weights. The quality feels subpar, and it’s clear the ladder isn’t built to withstand regular use. I wouldn’t recommend this product if you're looking for something reliable and long-lasting.,mani

Ozone Safe Locker for Home | Digital Lock | Safety Locker For Home | Non Motorized | Master & User PIN Code Access | Tijori Locker | Black | 16 Litres | 24 Months Warranty By Ozone (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,The secure locker arrived packaged in the branded box, cushioned on both sides with safety pads. However, the box lacked a proper seal, featuring only a simple cello tape adorned with the brand name. Setting up the safe proved to be straightforward, thanks to the provided instructions. It would have been beneficial if the instructions also covered setting the date and time, but I managed to navigate it by referring to their instructional YouTube video.

Upon opening the safe, I noticed it was disappointingly dirty. It's essential for the dispatch team to ensure cleanliness by removing paint, dust, and other debris before shipping the product. The carpet in the lower slot, while present, is inadequately glued and doesn't fit properly. Furthermore, the carpet piece's size does not match the dimensions, resulting in unsightly folds. The key is flimsy and seems generic, I am worried that any one with similar key can open the locker which totally defies the purpose of having the locker at first place.

The outer body of the safe is robust and well-constructed, seemingly made in India. However, my concern lies with the locking mechanism, which is made in China and appears flimsy. Only time will reveal the true durability of the safe. Additionally, the product seems slightly overpriced compared to competitors such as Amazon Basics safe lockers.

Despite these drawbacks, I recommend the product based on its overall performance and construction.

Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL (Modular,1 Piece),5.0 out of 5 stars,Firstly, the modular design of this broom is very convenient. It comes in 1 piece, making it easy to assemble and use. The handle is also adjustable, which is perfect for someone like me who is on the shorter side. I can adjust the handle to my desired length for comfortable sweeping. One of the main features that drew me to this broom was the promise of no dust. I have always struggled with traditional brooms leaving behind a trail of dust and debris. However, the Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL lives up to its name. The bristles are made of soft, fine fibers that effectively pick up all the dust and dirt without scattering it around. This has made sweeping a much cleaner and less messy task. Another great feature of this broom is its XL size. The broom head is wider than most traditional brooms, which means I can cover more surface area with each sweep. This has significantly reduced my cleaning time. The broom is also lightweight, making it easy to maneuver around furniture and corners. The quality of this broom is top-notch. The bristles are strong and durable, and they have not shown any signs of wear and tear even after multiple uses. The handle is also sturdy and feels comfortable to hold.,One Malabar Hill

Scotch-Brite Plastic Spin Mop Head and Handle (Suitable for Scotch-Brite 2 in 1 Spin Mop Only),3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this mop from Scotch Brite because I was frustrated with the Prestige ones, many of which now seem to be fake copies. Although this one is a bit pricey, it’s been working well after several months of use.

Pros:
1) The spin mechanism is effective; it dries quickly after just two spins.
2) The mopping material is decent and gets the job done, although it mops in patches due to the design.
3) It’s very easy to assemble.
4) You can buy just the mop stick alone if you already have a mop tub.

Cons:
1) The mop’s thread material is quite delicate. After the first wash, at least three strands came out, and a few more falls off with each use. And will continue for sure, I know.

Overall, I’m still using it. It’s average but functional for daily use.

Scotch-Brite Plastic Spin Mop Head and Handle (Suitable for Scotch-Brite 2 in 1 Spin Mop Only),3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this mop from Scotch Brite because I was frustrated with the Prestige ones, many of which now seem to be fake copies. Although this one is a bit pricey, it’s been working well after several months of use.

Pros:
1) The spin mechanism is effective; it dries quickly after just two spins.
2) The mopping material is decent and gets the job done, although it mops in patches due to the design.
3) It’s very easy to assemble.
4) You can buy just the mop stick alone if you already have a mop tub.

Cons:
1) The mop’s thread material is quite delicate. After the first wash, at least three strands came out, and a few more falls off with each use. And will continue for sure, I know.

Overall, I’m still using it. It’s average but functional for daily use.

Rushwak Bathroom Cleaning Brush with Wiper Upgraded 3 in 1 Toilet Brush Bathroom Brush with Long Handle 180° Rotate Bathroom Floor Cleaning Brush Bathroom Cleaning Accessories (Multicolor),5.0 out of 5 stars,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I recently purchased the bathroom cleaning brush with a wiper, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way possible! This product is a game-changer when it comes to keeping my bathroom spotless and gleaming.

First and foremost, the quality of this brush is outstanding. The bristles are sturdy and durable, ensuring they don't wear out quickly even with regular use. The handle is comfortable to grip, and the overall construction feels solid and well-made. I can tell that this brush is built to last, which makes it a fantastic investment for my cleaning arsenal.

The wiper feature is what truly sets this bathroom brush apart from others on the market. It's incredibly handy for wiping away excess water and cleaning solution, leaving my bathroom surfaces completely dry and streak-free. This saves me a lot of time and effort, as I don't have to reach for a separate cloth or paper towel to wipe down surfaces after scrubbing.

Cleaning with this brush is a breeze. The bristles do an excellent job of tackling tough stains and grime without scratching or damaging my bathroom fixtures. Plus, the wiper efficiently collects the residue, making the whole process more efficient and thorough.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with the bathroom cleaning brush with a wiper. Its impressive quality, efficient cleaning power, and convenient design have made my cleaning routine much more enjoyable. If you're looking for a top-notch bathroom cleaning tool, I highly recommend giving this brush a try. You won't be disappointed!

The video quality is too good and the setup is very easy. But the product needs lot of improvements which I am listing out below.
1. The tilt option is not that great and you can't focus the floor and door at the same time if it is installed above 5 feet high.
2. The 2 way talk option is just for name sake. The speaker quality is one of the worst one could imagine. You literally need to keep your ears in the camera to hear what the other one speaks.
3. Sound notifications and motion notifications are annoying which made me to disable them. Sound of crows and dogs far from home are detected (which happens all the time) and sends notifications. Similarly screen movements are sent as motion detection notifications. Detection of Human voice and motion alone could have been helpful and solved the real need.
4. Onvif never works. It asks for Password reset but if I select that nothing happens but freezing.
5. Smart controls seems not working. I have scheduled things for eg. Switch on the recording when it is 8am. But it never started to record.
6. Also there is no option to automate recording like Stop recording from Night 8 to Morning 8 every day.
7. Option to view in PC is too naive. If I wanted to view the feeds from office (or other phone restricted place), I can't do that as I need to scan the QR shown by the webpage through the mobile app. Even then it hardly works/opens.

CP PLUS 3 MP Full HD Smart Wi-fi CCTV Camera | 360° Pan & Tilt | View & Talk | Motion Alert | Night Vision | SD Card (Up to 128 GB) | Alexa & OK Google | 2-Way Talk | IR Distance 10Mtr | CP-E35A,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have bought 2 of them for my home to monitor my kids. The video quality is too good and the setup is very easy. But the product needs lot of improvements which I am listing out below.
1. The tilt option is not that great and you can't focus the floor and door at the same time if it is installed above 5 feet high.
2. The 2 way talk option is just for name sake. The speaker quality is one of the worst one could imagine. You literally need to keep your ears in the camera to hear what the other one speaks.
3. Sound notifications and motion notifications are annoying which made me to disable them. Sound of crows and dogs far from home are detected (which happens all the time) and sends notifications. Similarly screen movements are sent as motion detection notifications. Detection of Human voice and motion alone could have been helpful and solved the real need.
4. Onvif never works. It asks for Password reset but if I select that nothing happens but freezing.
5. Smart controls seems not working. I have scheduled things for eg. Switch on the recording when it is 8am. But it never started to record.
6. Also there is no option to automate recording like Stop recording from Night 8 to Morning 8 every day.
7. Option to view in PC is too naive. If I wanted to view the feeds from office (or other phone restricted place), I can't do that as I need to scan the QR shown by the webpage through the mobile app. Even then it hardly works/opens.

Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a reliable and effective cleaning solution that effortlessly balances form and function. With a sturdy build and thoughtful design, these sponges prove to be a versatile companion in tackling various cleaning tasks around the house.

The pack's inclusion of six sponges ensures an extended period of use, making it a cost-effective option for those who require a long-lasting cleaning tool. The dual-sided design, featuring a scrubbing side and a softer wiping side, offers the flexibility needed to address both stubborn stains and delicate surfaces. This adaptability proves especially handy in the kitchen, where grime and grease are common adversaries.

The scrubbing side effectively removes tough residue without wearing down too quickly, while the wiping side maintains its integrity through multiple uses.

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this product in May-2024, total 3 nos for my different bathroom showers. After almost 3 months of usage. I'm forced to post this review. So everything was fine till date. Even the filter was doing a good job. The problem comes when u want to replace the cartridge or u want to change the position of the cartridge. So 1st time I changed the direction of cartridge from the filter upside down. This is required to be done as per the company's instruction. It took hell lot of ime to do this job..I don't know why they have made this filter and cartridge assembly in such a bad design that u cannot remove the cartridge from the filter. I did this anyhow and second time I tried this today with another filter but the cartridge is not getting separated whatever I tried. If the manufacturer wanted to sell cartridge as a replacement or consumable item then it should have been user friendly. Even entire cartridge got damaged but it didn't come out. I am had Even purchased extra cartridge for this filter..it's a waste for me now..I don't know any other person faced the same problems but this is the worst design i must say. Again the filter is expensive around 2k..u cannot waste this much money for 3-4 months usage.i would request water science team to see this and help me out,Pranav Kankee

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had ordered 2 filters inspite of many bad reviews. One filter is working fine but second has water leaking from the body. Installation is easy but the key tool provided is useless to say the least.
Edit: the filter which was working fine was not used for 15 days and now it has choked. Water is not passing through it. Such useless products seems they are more reliant on paid reviews otherwise there is no explanation to generally good reviews when both the products i recieved were faulty,av123456

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this product in May-2024, total 3 nos for my different bathroom showers. After almost 3 months of usage. I'm forced to post this review. So everything was fine till date. Even the filter was doing a good job. The problem comes when u want to replace the cartridge or u want to change the position of the cartridge. So 1st time I changed the direction of cartridge from the filter upside down. This is required to be done as per the company's instruction. It took hell lot of ime to do this job..I don't know why they have made this filter and cartridge assembly in such a bad design that u cannot remove the cartridge from the filter. I did this anyhow and second time I tried this today with another filter but the cartridge is not getting separated whatever I tried. If the manufacturer wanted to sell cartridge as a replacement or consumable item then it should have been user friendly. Even entire cartridge got damaged but it didn't come out. I am had Even purchased extra cartridge for this filter..it's a waste for me now..I don't know any other person faced the same problems but this is the worst design i must say. Again the filter is expensive around 2k..u cannot waste this much money for 3-4 months usage.i would request water science team to see this and help me out,Pranav Kankee

Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product to use for once and all. It is for day to day normal use and for normal stain utensils. Thank you.,S.S.
Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),4.0 out of 5 stars,Have always been purchasing the original scotch brite pads since they don't leave behind residue on the plates which we then inevitably digest while eating off plates. Because, let's face it, how much ever we wash the plates, there is always micro-residue from the cheap ripped off scrub pads in the market. The Scotch Brite scrub pads don't degrade like their cheap counterparts and hence last longer.

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this bottle cleaner. This is the second one I have ordered. I have kept one each at my home and my in law's place. It does the job. It does reach the bottom corners of the bottles as claimed. Overall a good one. I use it mostly for the kids bottles. It has a good reach. It dries quickly once you shake off as much water as you can.
The sponge is detachable from the handle as mentioned in the product description, to enable it to be changed once the sponge weras out. Now I haven't checked if the sponge head is available separately. Otherwise this is a bit expensive.,Mom to an autistic kid.
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,The scrubber given is very good and it cleans the milk residue properly , the only issue is that the handle detaches and the scrubber stays the bottle which is very hard to remove,Udayani

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this bottle cleaner for cleaning steel water bottle. I was facing issue with local brushes where the sponge on the lower part of the brush would get off quickly creating issues in cleaning the bottom of the bottle from inside. Did purchase this product with the hopes that it would solve this issue and the product delivered true to my expectations.

The only downside I see is that if the mouth of the bottle is a bit smaller, there can be issues in getting the brush outside without the risk of cleaning brush stuck inside the bottle.,Shantanu

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,4.0 out of 5 stars,Updating my review after one month of use. No change in my rating and just updating more prons and cons

Pros
1. Good indoor camera for normal use.
2. Configuring is easy
3.Tapo app is responsive and working good
4. Video Clarity is ok
5. Sound is ok
6. Rotation is smooth , but a very small sound while rotating. A person who is standing near to camera can notice this sound
7. Zooming is ok , but no optical zoom
8. Night vision is good
9. You can add presets and presets are working good. I am specifically telling this because presets won't work well in some other brand cameraz . But for tapo it is working very good.

10. You can adjust rotation angle and it is one of the feature missing in other camera.

11. Person detection is working well and you can easily differtiate normal motion detection with person detection by a person symbol on thumbnails.

Cons
1. Cloud storage is expensive
2. No optical zoom, only digital zoom. I didn't like zoom clarity compared to other 3mp models. If you want to zoom a large distance , don't take this.i own an ezviz 1k camera and i liked zoom clarity of that than this.
3. Can't control the siren as per our will.siren works only in motion detection. So if a small insect is flying , then it will make sound. But we can restrict it to human detection. I always prefer an alarm with a button which we can trigger from app.
4. Play back or recorded video in memory card fast-forward option is not via slider. You can select a speed and it will fast forward based on that. But I always prefer a slider for fast-forward.

5. Tapo is autorotating sometimes. Not sure why . I don't want this feature.
6. One major con I noticed is the wifi network updation . Most of the cameras now a days allow you to change wifi network via app . But for tapo we can't change wifi via app. I can see network selection is ready only field and no action on that.

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was skeptical when this camera was recommended to me. It looked both too easy to be of use, and too complicated to actually set up and use. I couldn't have been more wrong. This TP-Link Tapo security camera is just what I needed. I bought one to try and see, and the minute it was set up and I could see what it could do, Immediately ordered three more. It is an easy setup task, and the benefits of having them are so much more than I would have expected. They are also more affordable than I expected. I now have one in each of my main rooms, and I can see what's happening in my house from the office desk. I have yet to try to access my house through the camera from another country, but I have no doubt that it would work. I use it to make sure my pets are OK. The camera pans, tilts, has night vision, records, has a privacy mode, can be wall mounted or free standing, and I can talk through the camera, which will be a weight off my mind when I have to go abroad and need to see if my pet sitter is actually doing what has been asked of them. If I can feel like this about my pets, I can imagine how a parent might feel to be able to watch their children through them! I recommend these cameras with no hesitation. Just FYI - there is an option to sign up for a monthly payable cloud storage system for these cameras. But if you are not keen to do that, you have to buy a storage card to record what you need. (There is an option to turn on the privacy mode which means the cameras will only record if the privacy mode is switched off.)

We were out of town for few days and this camera is suppose to monitor the house, but unfortunately it worked for only two days. WiFi was working fine other cameras from Philips was doing their job. But this Tapo camera went offline and did nothing for rest of the time. I have enabled the auto restart setting on daily intervals, but I believe that didn’t work. Tried to reach out customer care, but they will not respond, and since the product is working fine and issue is intermittent, was not able to show to the customer care. Think before you buy. Go with Philips cameras as they support offline recordings, though they are bit costly.,shreyas

Avec sa résolution 2K, la qualité d’image est impressionnante, offrant des vidéos nettes et claires, ce qui permet de capturer les moindres détails, même dans des conditions de faible luminosité. L’angle de vision de 360° et la possibilité de faire pivoter la caméra à distance via l’application Tapo ajoutent une flexibilité appréciable, permettant de couvrir une large zone avec un seul appareil.

L’installation est simple et rapide, même pour les moins technophiles. L’application Tapo est intuitive, rendant le contrôle de la caméra et l’accès aux vidéos enregistrées très faciles. De plus, la fonctionnalité de détection de mouvement et les notifications en temps réel sont très utiles pour rester informé de ce qui se passe chez soi.

Cependant, il y a quelques points à améliorer. Par exemple, la caméra nécessite une connexion Wi-Fi stable pour fonctionner de manière optimale, ce qui peut être un problème si le signal est faible. De plus, bien que la caméra soit livrée avec un emplacement pour carte microSD, le stockage en ligne est payant, ce qui peut représenter un coût supplémentaire à long terme.

En dépit de ces petits inconvénients, la Tapo 2K C210 reste un excellent rapport qualité-prix et je la recommande sans hésitation pour sécuriser votre domicile.

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,4.0 out of 5 stars,Updating my review after one month of use. No change in my rating and just updating more prons and cons

Pros
1. Good indoor camera for normal use.
2. Configuring is easy
3.Tapo app is responsive and working good
4. Video Clarity is ok
5. Sound is ok
6. Rotation is smooth , but a very small sound while rotating. A person who is standing near to camera can notice this sound
7. Zooming is ok , but no optical zoom
8. Night vision is good
9. You can add presets and presets are working good. I am specifically telling this because presets won't work well in some other brand cameraz . But for tapo it is working very good.

10. You can adjust rotation angle and it is one of the feature missing in other camera.

11. Person detection is working well and you can easily differtiate normal motion detection with person detection by a person symbol on thumbnails.

Cons
1. Cloud storage is expensive
2. No optical zoom, only digital zoom. I didn't like zoom clarity compared to other 3mp models. If you want to zoom a large distance , don't take this.i own an ezviz 1k camera and i liked zoom clarity of that than this.
3. Can't control the siren as per our will.siren works only in motion detection. So if a small insect is flying , then it will make sound. But we can restrict it to human detection. I always prefer an alarm with a button which we can trigger from app.
4. Play back or recorded video in memory card fast-forward option is not via slider. You can select a speed and it will fast forward based on that. But I always prefer a slider for fast-forward.

5. Tapo is autorotating sometimes. Not sure why . I don't want this feature.
6. One major con I noticed is the wifi network updation . Most of the cameras now a days allow you to change wifi network via app . But for tapo we can't change wifi via app. I can see network selection is ready only field and no action on that.

It looked both too easy to be of use, and too complicated to actually set up and use. I couldn't have been more wrong. This TP-Link Tapo security camera is just what I needed. I bought one to try and see, and the minute it was set up and I could see what it could do, Immediately ordered three more. It is an easy setup task, and the benefits of having them are so much more than I would have expected. They are also more affordable than I expected. I now have one in each of my main rooms, and I can see what's happening in my house from the office desk. I have yet to try to access my house through the camera from another country, but I have no doubt that it would work. I use it to make sure my pets are OK. The camera pans, tilts, has night vision, records, has a privacy mode, can be wall mounted or free standing, and I can talk through the camera, which will be a weight off my mind when I have to go abroad and need to see if my pet sitter is actually doing what has been asked of them. If I can feel like this about my pets, I can imagine how a parent might feel to be able to watch their children through them! I recommend these cameras with no hesitation. Just FYI - there is an option to sign up for a monthly payable cloud storage system for these cameras. But if you are not keen to do that, you have to buy a storage card to record what you need. (There is an option to turn on the privacy mode which means the cameras will only record if the privacy mode is switched off.)

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s been about 4 days since I got this product and I’m happy with it as a baby monitor so far. It was easy to set up. As it can rest on any flat surface, I didn’t need to install it anywhere but it comes with all the necessary accessories for a wall mount. But because of the flat design I can put it anywhere near my baby, and even if I move her to another room, I can take the camera with me. The 360° rotation is impressive and the video quality is great, especially since I use it on the phone mostly—even 480p is sufficient.

The best features are the sound and movement triggers. If my little one wakes up annd moves around and/or cries, notifications are sent to my phone and the feed is also recorded for that portion (in case you want to check what disturbed them). This is great if you need to be in another room—gives you peace of mind. In fact, the sound trigger feature is not available in other cameras in this price range so this was the main deciding factor for my choice. The live feed is definitely a boon to make sure baby is fine when you’re away from her. You can also zoom in on the live feed, which is a cool little feature that I was not expecting. Plus, with the recording feature, you get to have little memories of the baby waking up saved away for the future :)

The only feature I’ve not had a chance to test is night vision but some videos of this camera I saw on YouTube seem to show that this feature is solid in the camera.

Right now I’m on the Imou Life trial subscription because it’s free and will save all recordings to the cloud (up to 3 days). I’ll move to a micro SD soon though. Thinking of also getting a power bank to make it truly portable. Overall, this device is great value and I’d recommend it for parents looking for a baby monitor.

I am using it since 2 years and the performance is still decent. It has decent night vision and quality. It rotates 360° horizontally and 270° vertically. You can use sd card or buy their subscription for storage which I will talk about later. But!!! The most annoying thingಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ!!! Is actually it's software (⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)(⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)!!! I should write this thing in app's review but I think it should be added in product review too as it shows your experience using the product. So the first and major problem is that the app logs out every 3-4 days you don't use it which is very annoying. Imagine there is an emergency at your home and you need to turn on the camera ASAP, you open the app and boom!! Throw your emergency away and login here(⁠◠⁠ω◕⁠)!!
Also trust me, it is veryyy like very complicated and hard to login. The other issue is bro why do you even sell you products in India if you don't want to accept India's payment options. You can't use UPI apps it tells you to use paypal, bro seriously how the hell am I supposed to use paypal here or else use international cards :D!! And don't just use international cards but you have to buy the monthly subscription and trust me again it is very hard to cancel the subscription. I only need the camera twice or thrice a year so why should I waste my money in buying the subscription every month!?!??
Well this is my review it ends here.

In first order the product had defect but when I contacted it's customer support they reverted immediately and was replaced in 2 days with new one. So they after service is also very good.

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s been about 4 days since I got this product and I’m happy with it as a baby monitor so far. It was easy to set up. As it can rest on any flat surface, I didn’t need to install it anywhere but it comes with all the necessary accessories for a wall mount. But because of the flat design I can put it anywhere near my baby, and even if I move her to another room, I can take the camera with me. The 360° rotation is impressive and the video quality is great, especially since I use it on the phone mostly—even 480p is sufficient.

The best features are the sound and movement triggers. If my little one wakes up annd moves around and/or cries, notifications are sent to my phone and the feed is also recorded for that portion (in case you want to check what disturbed them). This is great if you need to be in another room—gives you peace of mind. In fact, the sound trigger feature is not available in other cameras in this price range so this was the main deciding factor for my choice. The live feed is definitely a boon to make sure baby is fine when you’re away from her. You can also zoom in on the live feed, which is a cool little feature that I was not expecting. Plus, with the recording feature, you get to have little memories of the baby waking up saved away for the future :)

The only feature I’ve not had a chance to test is night vision but some videos of this camera I saw on YouTube seem to show that this feature is solid in the camera.

Right now I’m on the Imou Life trial subscription because it’s free and will save all recordings to the cloud (up to 3 days). I’ll move to a micro SD soon though. Thinking of also getting a power bank to make it truly portable. Overall, this device is great value and I’d recommend it for parents looking for a baby monitor.

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,3.0 out of 5 stars,The camera is really good. I am using it since 2 years and the performance is still decent. It has decent night vision and quality. It rotates 360° horizontally and 270° vertically. You can use sd card or buy their subscription for storage which I will talk about later. But!!! The most annoying thingಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ!!! Is actually it's software (⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)(⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)!!! I should write this thing in app's review but I think it should be added in product review too as it shows your experience using the product. So the first and major problem is that the app logs out every 3-4 days you don't use it which is very annoying. Imagine there is an emergency at your home and you need to turn on the camera ASAP, you open the app and boom!! Throw your emergency away and login here(⁠◠⁠ω◕⁠)!!
Also trust me, it is veryyy like very complicated and hard to login. The other issue is bro why do you even sell you products in India if you don't want to accept India's payment options. You can't use UPI apps it tells you to use paypal, bro seriously how the hell am I supposed to use paypal here or else use international cards :D!! And don't just use international cards but you have to buy the monthly subscription and trust me again it is very hard to cancel the subscription. I only need the camera twice or thrice a year so why should I waste my money in buying the subscription every month!?!??
Well this is my review it ends here.

In first order the product had defect but when I contacted it's customer support they reverted immediately and was replaced in 2 days with new one. So they after service is also very good. Just one thing I am facing problem is SIREN is not playing properly it's getting stop in 2-3 seconds instead of 30 seconds. But overall product is fabulous in the price that is offered. Just go for it.,Amazon Customer

TNT THE NEXT TREND Ladder for Home use Heavy Duty Steel with Wide Steps and Top Platform with Anti Slip and Anti Skid Shoes can be Used as Step Stool in Office and Industrial Purpose (Black) (3 Step),1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this 2-step ladder with the expectation of it being sturdy, especially given the company’s claim that it can handle up to 150 kg. However, after just six months of light, home use by individuals weighing around 70-80 kg, one of the foot steps cracked, making it unsafe to use. This is disappointing for a product advertised as durable and capable of supporting much heavier weights. The quality feels subpar, and it’s clear the ladder isn’t built to withstand regular use. I wouldn’t recommend this product if you're looking for something reliable and long-lasting.,mani

Ozone Safe Locker for Home | Digital Lock | Safety Locker For Home | Non Motorized | Master & User PIN Code Access | Tijori Locker | Black | 16 Litres | 24 Months Warranty By Ozone (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,The secure locker arrived packaged in the branded box, cushioned on both sides with safety pads. However, the box lacked a proper seal, featuring only a simple cello tape adorned with the brand name. Setting up the safe proved to be straightforward, thanks to the provided instructions. It would have been beneficial if the instructions also covered setting the date and time, but I managed to navigate it by referring to their instructional YouTube video.

Upon opening the safe, I noticed it was disappointingly dirty. It's essential for the dispatch team to ensure cleanliness by removing paint, dust, and other debris before shipping the product. The carpet in the lower slot, while present, is inadequately glued and doesn't fit properly. Furthermore, the carpet piece's size does not match the dimensions, resulting in unsightly folds. The key is flimsy and seems generic, I am worried that any one with similar key can open the locker which totally defies the purpose of having the locker at first place.

The outer body of the safe is robust and well-constructed, seemingly made in India. However, my concern lies with the locking mechanism, which is made in China and appears flimsy. Only time will reveal the true durability of the safe. Additionally, the product seems slightly overpriced compared to competitors such as Amazon Basics safe lockers.

Despite these drawbacks, I recommend the product based on its overall performance and construction.

Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL (Modular,1 Piece),5.0 out of 5 stars,Firstly, the modular design of this broom is very convenient. It comes in 1 piece, making it easy to assemble and use. The handle is also adjustable, which is perfect for someone like me who is on the shorter side. I can adjust the handle to my desired length for comfortable sweeping. One of the main features that drew me to this broom was the promise of no dust. I have always struggled with traditional brooms leaving behind a trail of dust and debris. However, the Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL lives up to its name. The bristles are made of soft, fine fibers that effectively pick up all the dust and dirt without scattering it around. This has made sweeping a much cleaner and less messy task. Another great feature of this broom is its XL size. The broom head is wider than most traditional brooms, which means I can cover more surface area with each sweep. This has significantly reduced my cleaning time. The broom is also lightweight, making it easy to maneuver around furniture and corners. The quality of this broom is top-notch. The bristles are strong and durable, and they have not shown any signs of wear and tear even after multiple uses. The handle is also sturdy and feels comfortable to hold.,One Malabar Hill

Scotch-Brite Plastic Spin Mop Head and Handle (Suitable for Scotch-Brite 2 in 1 Spin Mop Only),3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this mop from Scotch Brite because I was frustrated with the Prestige ones, many of which now seem to be fake copies. Although this one is a bit pricey, it’s been working well after several months of use.

Pros:
1) The spin mechanism is effective; it dries quickly after just two spins.
2) The mopping material is decent and gets the job done, although it mops in patches due to the design.
3) It’s very easy to assemble.
4) You can buy just the mop stick alone if you already have a mop tub.

Cons:
1) The mop’s thread material is quite delicate. After the first wash, at least three strands came out, and a few more falls off with each use. And will continue for sure, I know.

Overall, I’m still using it. It’s average but functional for daily use.

Rushwak Bathroom Cleaning Brush with Wiper Upgraded 3 in 1 Toilet Brush Bathroom Brush with Long Handle 180° Rotate Bathroom Floor Cleaning Brush Bathroom Cleaning Accessories (Multicolor),5.0 out of 5 stars,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I recently purchased the bathroom cleaning brush with a wiper, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way possible! This product is a game-changer when it comes to keeping my bathroom spotless and gleaming.

First and foremost, the quality of this brush is outstanding. The bristles are sturdy and durable, ensuring they don't wear out quickly even with regular use. The handle is comfortable to grip, and the overall construction feels solid and well-made. I can tell that this brush is built to last, which makes it a fantastic investment for my cleaning arsenal.

The wiper feature is what truly sets this bathroom brush apart from others on the market. It's incredibly handy for wiping away excess water and cleaning solution, leaving my bathroom surfaces completely dry and streak-free. This saves me a lot of time and effort, as I don't have to reach for a separate cloth or paper towel to wipe down surfaces after scrubbing.

Cleaning with this brush is a breeze. The bristles do an excellent job of tackling tough stains and grime without scratching or damaging my bathroom fixtures. Plus, the wiper efficiently collects the residue, making the whole process more efficient and thorough.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with the bathroom cleaning brush with a wiper. Its impressive quality, efficient cleaning power, and convenient design have made my cleaning routine much more enjoyable. If you're looking for a top-notch bathroom cleaning tool, I highly recommend giving this brush a try. You won't be disappointed!

The video quality is too good and the setup is very easy. But the product needs lot of improvements which I am listing out below.
1. The tilt option is not that great and you can't focus the floor and door at the same time if it is installed above 5 feet high.
2. The 2 way talk option is just for name sake. The speaker quality is one of the worst one could imagine. You literally need to keep your ears in the camera to hear what the other one speaks.
3. Sound notifications and motion notifications are annoying which made me to disable them. Sound of crows and dogs far from home are detected (which happens all the time) and sends notifications. Similarly screen movements are sent as motion detection notifications. Detection of Human voice and motion alone could have been helpful and solved the real need.
4. Onvif never works. It asks for Password reset but if I select that nothing happens but freezing.
5. Smart controls seems not working. I have scheduled things for eg. Switch on the recording when it is 8am. But it never started to record.
6. Also there is no option to automate recording like Stop recording from Night 8 to Morning 8 every day.
7. Option to view in PC is too naive. If I wanted to view the feeds from office (or other phone restricted place), I can't do that as I need to scan the QR shown by the webpage through the mobile app. Even then it hardly works/opens.

7. Option to view in PC is too naive. If I wanted to view the feeds from office (or other phone restricted place), I can't do that as I need to scan the QR shown by the webpage through the mobile app. Even then it hardly works/opens.

I can't even return it. I realise it after I had made the purchase. Though if you are looking for cameras go for a little cheaper one. Because you will get the same quality of camera.i purchased it at Rs. 1499.,Garima

Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reasonable pricing and of the correct size for cleaning purposes. Easy to use and very practical.,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a reliable and effective cleaning solution that effortlessly balances form and function. With a sturdy build and thoughtful design, these sponges prove to be a versatile companion in tackling various cleaning tasks around the house.

The pack's inclusion of six sponges ensures an extended period of use, making it a cost-effective option for those who require a long-lasting cleaning tool. The dual-sided design, featuring a scrubbing side and a softer wiping side, offers the flexibility needed to address both stubborn stains and delicate surfaces. This adaptability proves especially handy in the kitchen, where grime and grease are common adversaries.

One of the standout features of these sponges is their durability. The scrubbing side effectively removes tough residue without wearing down too quickly, while the wiping side maintains its integrity through multiple uses. This robustness translates into fewer replacements and less waste, contributing to a more sustainable cleaning routine.

While the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge pack delivers on its promises, there is room for slight improvement. The scrubbing surface, while effective, may feel abrasive on more delicate items. Additionally, a greater variety of colors or patterns could add a touch of visual appeal to the utilitarian design.

In conclusion, the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a dependable and practical cleaning tool that shines in its ability to adapt to different cleaning challenges. Its longevity, dual-sided functionality, and overall durability make it a solid investment for anyone seeking a reliable cleaning companion. While some refinements could enhance its aesthetic appeal, its performance remains the true highlight. Say goodbye to stubborn stains and embrace the convenience of these scrub sponges in your cleaning arsenal.

This is required to be done as per the company's instruction. It took hell lot of ime to do this job..I don't know why they have made this filter and cartridge assembly in such a bad design that u cannot remove the cartridge from the filter. I did this anyhow and second time I tried this today with another filter but the cartridge is not getting separated whatever I tried. If the manufacturer wanted to sell cartridge as a replacement or consumable item then it should have been user friendly. Even entire cartridge got damaged but it didn't come out.

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had ordered 2 filters inspite of many bad reviews. One filter is working fine but second has water leaking from the body. Installation is easy but the key tool provided is useless to say the least.
Edit: the filter which was working fine was not used for 15 days and now it has choked. Water is not passing through it. Such useless products seems they are more reliant on paid reviews otherwise there is no explanation to generally good reviews when both the products i recieved were faulty,av123456

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought two of this product for it's separate use, but one didn't work after a month seems like a the filter is blocked due to which the water is, since it's already passed refund schedule this been a waste of money for me 😞,Shiv
WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,5.0 out of 5 stars,This hard water filter works amazingly well. It's really helpful for people living in Pune since the water is very hard.

I found it super easy to install as they provide the installation kit and the connectors.

It's economical and have noticed improvement in the quality of water. Will update this review after few months of use.,Dinesh O V
WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,4.0 out of 5 stars,Does it's job well. Quality and manual is good. Spare connectors are helpful. Changing cartridge every 6 months is a task and cost involved.,P.L.Kori
WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had ordered 2 filters inspite of many bad reviews. One filter is working fine but second has water leaking from the body. Installation is easy but the key tool provided is useless to say the least.
Edit: the filter which was working fine was not used for 15 days and now it has choked. Water is not passing through it. Such useless products seems they are more reliant on paid reviews otherwise there is no explanation to generally good reviews when both the products i recieved were faulty,av123456

Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product to use for once and all. It is for day to day normal use and for normal stain utensils. Thank you.,S.S.
Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),4.0 out of 5 stars,Have always been purchasing the original scotch brite pads since they don't leave behind residue on the plates which we then inevitably digest while eating off plates. Because, let's face it, how much ever we wash the plates, there is always micro-residue from the cheap ripped off scrub pads in the market. The Scotch Brite scrub pads don't degrade like their cheap counterparts and hence last longer.

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this bottle cleaner. This is the second one I have ordered. I have kept one each at my home and my in law's place. It does the job. It does reach the bottom corners of the bottles as claimed. Overall a good one. I use it mostly for the kids bottles. It has a good reach. It dries quickly once you shake off as much water as you can.
The sponge is detachable from the handle as mentioned in the product description, to enable it to be changed once the sponge weras out. Now I haven't checked if the sponge head is available separately. Otherwise this is a bit expensive.,Mom to an autistic kid.
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,The scrubber given is very good and it cleans the milk residue properly , the only issue is that the handle detaches and the scrubber stays the bottle which is very hard to remove,Udayani

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this bottle cleaner for cleaning steel water bottle. I was facing issue with local brushes where the sponge on the lower part of the brush would get off quickly creating issues in cleaning the bottom of the bottle from inside. Did purchase this product with the hopes that it would solve this issue and the product delivered true to my expectations.

The only downside I see is that if the mouth of the bottle is a bit smaller, there can be issues in getting the brush outside without the risk of cleaning brush stuck inside the bottle.,Shantanu
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,Getting the perfect bottle cleaning brush is a hard task for Mommies.

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,4.0 out of 5 stars,Updating my review after one month of use. No change in my rating and just updating more prons and cons

Pros
1. Good indoor camera for normal use.
2. Configuring is easy
3.Tapo app is responsive and working good
4. Video Clarity is ok
5. Sound is ok
6. Rotation is smooth , but a very small sound while rotating. A person who is standing near to camera can notice this sound
7. Zooming is ok , but no optical zoom
8. Night vision is good
9. You can add presets and presets are working good. I am specifically telling this because presets won't work well in some other brand cameraz . But for tapo it is working very good.

10. You can adjust rotation angle and it is one of the feature missing in other camera.

11. Person detection is working well and you can easily differtiate normal motion detection with person detection by a person symbol on thumbnails.

Cons
1. Cloud storage is expensive
2. No optical zoom, only digital zoom. I didn't like zoom clarity compared to other 3mp models. If you want to zoom a large distance , don't take this.i own an ezviz 1k camera and i liked zoom clarity of that than this.
3. Can't control the siren as per our will.siren works only in motion detection. So if a small insect is flying , then it will make sound. But we can restrict it to human detection. I always prefer an alarm with a button which we can trigger from app.
4. Play back or recorded video in memory card fast-forward option is not via slider. You can select a speed and it will fast forward based on that. But I always prefer a slider for fast-forward.

5. Tapo is autorotating sometimes. Not sure why . I don't want this feature.
6. One major con I noticed is the wifi network updation . Most of the cameras now a days allow you to change wifi network via app . But for tapo we can't change wifi via app. I can see network selection is ready only field and no action on that.

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was skeptical when this camera was recommended to me. It looked both too easy to be of use, and too complicated to actually set up and use. I couldn't have been more wrong. This TP-Link Tapo security camera is just what I needed. I bought one to try and see, and the minute it was set up and I could see what it could do, Immediately ordered three more. It is an easy setup task, and the benefits of having them are so much more than I would have expected. They are also more affordable than I expected. I now have one in each of my main rooms, and I can see what's happening in my house from the office desk. I have yet to try to access my house through the camera from another country, but I have no doubt that it would work. I use it to make sure my pets are OK. The camera pans, tilts, has night vision, records, has a privacy mode, can be wall mounted or free standing, and I can talk through the camera, which will be a weight off my mind when I have to go abroad and need to see if my pet sitter is actually doing what has been asked of them. If I can feel like this about my pets, I can imagine how a parent might feel to be able to watch their children through them! I recommend these cameras with no hesitation. Just FYI - there is an option to sign up for a monthly payable cloud storage system for these cameras. But if you are not keen to do that, you have to buy a storage card to record what you need. (There is an option to turn on the privacy mode which means the cameras will only record if the privacy mode is switched off.)

We were out of town for few days and this camera is suppose to monitor the house, but unfortunately it worked for only two days. WiFi was working fine other cameras from Philips was doing their job. But this Tapo camera went offline and did nothing for rest of the time. I have enabled the auto restart setting on daily intervals, but I believe that didn’t work. Tried to reach out customer care, but they will not respond, and since the product is working fine and issue is intermittent, was not able to show to the customer care. Think before you buy. Go with Philips cameras as they support offline recordings, though they are bit costly.,shreyas

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cette caméra est un excellent choix pour ceux qui recherchent une solution de surveillance domestique efficace et abordable. Avec sa résolution 2K, la qualité d’image est impressionnante, offrant des vidéos nettes et claires, ce qui permet de capturer les moindres détails, même dans des conditions de faible luminosité. L’angle de vision de 360° et la possibilité de faire pivoter la caméra à distance via l’application Tapo ajoutent une flexibilité appréciable, permettant de couvrir une large zone avec un seul appareil.

L’installation est simple et rapide, même pour les moins technophiles. L’application Tapo est intuitive, rendant le contrôle de la caméra et l’accès aux vidéos enregistrées très faciles. De plus, la fonctionnalité de détection de mouvement et les notifications en temps réel sont très utiles pour rester informé de ce qui se passe chez soi.

Cependant, il y a quelques points à améliorer. Par exemple, la caméra nécessite une connexion Wi-Fi stable pour fonctionner de manière optimale, ce qui peut être un problème si le signal est faible. De plus, bien que la caméra soit livrée avec un emplacement pour carte microSD, le stockage en ligne est payant, ce qui peut représenter un coût supplémentaire à long terme.

En dépit de ces petits inconvénients, la Tapo 2K C210 reste un excellent rapport qualité-prix et je la recommande sans hésitation pour sécuriser votre domicile.

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,4.0 out of 5 stars,Updating my review after one month of use. No change in my rating and just updating more prons and cons

Pros
1. Good indoor camera for normal use.
2. Configuring is easy
3.Tapo app is responsive and working good
4. Video Clarity is ok
5. Sound is ok
6. Rotation is smooth , but a very small sound while rotating. A person who is standing near to camera can notice this sound
7. Zooming is ok , but no optical zoom
8. Night vision is good
9. You can add presets and presets are working good. I am specifically telling this because presets won't work well in some other brand cameraz . But for tapo it is working very good.

10. You can adjust rotation angle and it is one of the feature missing in other camera.

11. Person detection is working well and you can easily differtiate normal motion detection with person detection by a person symbol on thumbnails.

Cons
1. Cloud storage is expensive
2. No optical zoom, only digital zoom. I didn't like zoom clarity compared to other 3mp models. If you want to zoom a large distance , don't take this.i own an ezviz 1k camera and i liked zoom clarity of that than this.
3. Can't control the siren as per our will.siren works only in motion detection. So if a small insect is flying , then it will make sound. But we can restrict it to human detection. I always prefer an alarm with a button which we can trigger from app.
4. Play back or recorded video in memory card fast-forward option is not via slider. You can select a speed and it will fast forward based on that. But I always prefer a slider for fast-forward.

5. Tapo is autorotating sometimes. Not sure why . I don't want this feature.
6. One major con I noticed is the wifi network updation . Most of the cameras now a days allow you to change wifi network via app . But for tapo we can't change wifi via app. I can see network selection is ready only field and no action on that.

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was skeptical when this camera was recommended to me. It looked both too easy to be of use, and too complicated to actually set up and use. I couldn't have been more wrong. This TP-Link Tapo security camera is just what I needed. I bought one to try and see, and the minute it was set up and I could see what it could do, Immediately ordered three more. It is an easy setup task, and the benefits of having them are so much more than I would have expected. They are also more affordable than I expected. I now have one in each of my main rooms, and I can see what's happening in my house from the office desk. I have yet to try to access my house through the camera from another country, but I have no doubt that it would work. I use it to make sure my pets are OK. The camera pans, tilts, has night vision, records, has a privacy mode, can be wall mounted or free standing, and I can talk through the camera, which will be a weight off my mind when I have to go abroad and need to see if my pet sitter is actually doing what has been asked of them. If I can feel like this about my pets, I can imagine how a parent might feel to be able to watch their children through them! I recommend these cameras with no hesitation. Just FYI - there is an option to sign up for a monthly payable cloud storage system for these cameras. But if you are not keen to do that, you have to buy a storage card to record what you need. (There is an option to turn on the privacy mode which means the cameras will only record if the privacy mode is switched off.)

We were out of town for few days and this camera is suppose to monitor the house, but unfortunately it worked for only two days. WiFi was working fine other cameras from Philips was doing their job. But this Tapo camera went offline and did nothing for rest of the time. I have enabled the auto restart setting on daily intervals, but I believe that didn’t work. Tried to reach out customer care, but they will not respond, and since the product is working fine and issue is intermittent, was not able to show to the customer care. Think before you buy. Go with Philips cameras as they support offline recordings, though they are bit costly.,shreyas

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cette caméra est un excellent choix pour ceux qui recherchent une solution de surveillance domestique efficace et abordable. Avec sa résolution 2K, la qualité d’image est impressionnante, offrant des vidéos nettes et claires, ce qui permet de capturer les moindres détails, même dans des conditions de faible luminosité. L’angle de vision de 360° et la possibilité de faire pivoter la caméra à distance via l’application Tapo ajoutent une flexibilité appréciable, permettant de couvrir une large zone avec un seul appareil.

L’installation est simple et rapide, même pour les moins technophiles. L’application Tapo est intuitive, rendant le contrôle de la caméra et l’accès aux vidéos enregistrées très faciles. De plus, la fonctionnalité de détection de mouvement et les notifications en temps réel sont très utiles pour rester informé de ce qui se passe chez soi.

Cependant, il y a quelques points à améliorer. Par exemple, la caméra nécessite une connexion Wi-Fi stable pour fonctionner de manière optimale, ce qui peut être un problème si le signal est faible. De plus, bien que la caméra soit livrée avec un emplacement pour carte microSD, le stockage en ligne est payant, ce qui peut représenter un coût supplémentaire à long terme.

En dépit de ces petits inconvénients, la Tapo 2K C210 reste un excellent rapport qualité-prix et je la recommande sans hésitation pour sécuriser votre domicile.

Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),3.0 out of 5 stars,The base is not stable by design. It swivels uncontrollably, and will fold over while scrubbing. So it is not possible to scrub without interruptions.

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s been about 4 days since I got this product and I’m happy with it as a baby monitor so far. It was easy to set up. As it can rest on any flat surface, I didn’t need to install it anywhere but it comes with all the necessary accessories for a wall mount. But because of the flat design I can put it anywhere near my baby, and even if I move her to another room, I can take the camera with me. The 360° rotation is impressive and the video quality is great, especially since I use it on the phone mostly—even 480p is sufficient.

The best features are the sound and movement triggers. If my little one wakes up annd moves around and/or cries, notifications are sent to my phone and the feed is also recorded for that portion (in case you want to check what disturbed them). This is great if you need to be in another room—gives you peace of mind. In fact, the sound trigger feature is not available in other cameras in this price range so this was the main deciding factor for my choice. The live feed is definitely a boon to make sure baby is fine when you’re away from her. You can also zoom in on the live feed, which is a cool little feature that I was not expecting. Plus, with the recording feature, you get to have little memories of the baby waking up saved away for the future :)

The only feature I’ve not had a chance to test is night vision but some videos of this camera I saw on YouTube seem to show that this feature is solid in the camera.

Right now I’m on the Imou Life trial subscription because it’s free and will save all recordings to the cloud (up to 3 days). I’ll move to a micro SD soon though. Thinking of also getting a power bank to make it truly portable. Overall, this device is great value and I’d recommend it for parents looking for a baby monitor.

I am using it since 2 years and the performance is still decent. It has decent night vision and quality. It rotates 360° horizontally and 270° vertically. You can use sd card or buy their subscription for storage which I will talk about later. But!!! The most annoying thingಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ!!! Is actually it's software (⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)(⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)!!! I should write this thing in app's review but I think it should be added in product review too as it shows your experience using the product. So the first and major problem is that the app logs out every 3-4 days you don't use it which is very annoying. Imagine there is an emergency at your home and you need to turn on the camera ASAP, you open the app and boom!! Throw your emergency away and login here(⁠◠⁠ω◕⁠)!!
Also trust me, it is veryyy like very complicated and hard to login. The other issue is bro why do you even sell you products in India if you don't want to accept India's payment options. You can't use UPI apps it tells you to use paypal, bro seriously how the hell am I supposed to use paypal here or else use international cards :D!! And don't just use international cards but you have to buy the monthly subscription and trust me again it is very hard to cancel the subscription. I only need the camera twice or thrice a year so why should I waste my money in buying the subscription every month!?!??
Well this is my review it ends here.

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,3.0 out of 5 stars,The camera is really good. I am using it since 2 years and the performance is still decent. It has decent night vision and quality. It rotates 360° horizontally and 270° vertically. You can use sd card or buy their subscription for storage which I will talk about later. But!!! The most annoying thingಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ!!! Is actually it's software (⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)(⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)!!! I should write this thing in app's review but I think it should be added in product review too as it shows your experience using the product. So the first and major problem is that the app logs out every 3-4 days you don't use it which is very annoying. Imagine there is an emergency at your home and you need to turn on the camera ASAP, you open the app and boom!! Throw your emergency away and login here(⁠◠⁠ω◕⁠)!!
Also trust me, it is veryyy like very complicated and hard to login. The other issue is bro why do you even sell you products in India if you don't want to accept India's payment options. You can't use UPI apps it tells you to use paypal, bro seriously how the hell am I supposed to use paypal here or else use international cards :D!! And don't just use international cards but you have to buy the monthly subscription and trust me again it is very hard to cancel the subscription. I only need the camera twice or thrice a year so why should I waste my money in buying the subscription every month!?!??
Well this is my review it ends here.

In first order the product had defect but when I contacted it's customer support they reverted immediately and was replaced in 2 days with new one. So they after service is also very good. Just one thing I am facing problem is SIREN is not playing properly it's getting stop in 2-3 seconds instead of 30 seconds. But overall product is fabulous in the price that is offered. Just go for it.,Amazon Customer

TNT THE NEXT TREND Ladder for Home use Heavy Duty Steel with Wide Steps and Top Platform with Anti Slip and Anti Skid Shoes can be Used as Step Stool in Office and Industrial Purpose (Black) (3 Step),1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this 2-step ladder with the expectation of it being sturdy, especially given the company’s claim that it can handle up to 150 kg. However, after just six months of light, home use by individuals weighing around 70-80 kg, one of the foot steps cracked, making it unsafe to use. This is disappointing for a product advertised as durable and capable of supporting much heavier weights. The quality feels subpar, and it’s clear the ladder isn’t built to withstand regular use. I wouldn’t recommend this product if you're looking for something reliable and long-lasting.,mani

Ozone Safe Locker for Home | Digital Lock | Safety Locker For Home | Non Motorized | Master & User PIN Code Access | Tijori Locker | Black | 16 Litres | 24 Months Warranty By Ozone (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,The secure locker arrived packaged in the branded box, cushioned on both sides with safety pads. However, the box lacked a proper seal, featuring only a simple cello tape adorned with the brand name. Setting up the safe proved to be straightforward, thanks to the provided instructions. It would have been beneficial if the instructions also covered setting the date and time, but I managed to navigate it by referring to their instructional YouTube video.

Upon opening the safe, I noticed it was disappointingly dirty. It's essential for the dispatch team to ensure cleanliness by removing paint, dust, and other debris before shipping the product. The carpet in the lower slot, while present, is inadequately glued and doesn't fit properly. Furthermore, the carpet piece's size does not match the dimensions, resulting in unsightly folds. The key is flimsy and seems generic, I am worried that any one with similar key can open the locker which totally defies the purpose of having the locker at first place.

The outer body of the safe is robust and well-constructed, seemingly made in India. However, my concern lies with the locking mechanism, which is made in China and appears flimsy. Only time will reveal the true durability of the safe. Additionally, the product seems slightly overpriced compared to competitors such as Amazon Basics safe lockers.

Despite these drawbacks, I recommend the product based on its overall performance and construction.

Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL (Modular,1 Piece),5.0 out of 5 stars,Firstly, the modular design of this broom is very convenient. It comes in 1 piece, making it easy to assemble and use. The handle is also adjustable, which is perfect for someone like me who is on the shorter side. I can adjust the handle to my desired length for comfortable sweeping. One of the main features that drew me to this broom was the promise of no dust. I have always struggled with traditional brooms leaving behind a trail of dust and debris. However, the Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL lives up to its name. The bristles are made of soft, fine fibers that effectively pick up all the dust and dirt without scattering it around. This has made sweeping a much cleaner and less messy task. Another great feature of this broom is its XL size. The broom head is wider than most traditional brooms, which means I can cover more surface area with each sweep. This has significantly reduced my cleaning time. The broom is also lightweight, making it easy to maneuver around furniture and corners. The quality of this broom is top-notch. The bristles are strong and durable, and they have not shown any signs of wear and tear even after multiple uses. The handle is also sturdy and feels comfortable to hold.,One Malabar Hill

Scotch-Brite Plastic Spin Mop Head and Handle (Suitable for Scotch-Brite 2 in 1 Spin Mop Only),3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this mop from Scotch Brite because I was frustrated with the Prestige ones, many of which now seem to be fake copies. Although this one is a bit pricey, it’s been working well after several months of use.

Pros:
1) The spin mechanism is effective; it dries quickly after just two spins.
2) The mopping material is decent and gets the job done, although it mops in patches due to the design.
3) It’s very easy to assemble.
4) You can buy just the mop stick alone if you already have a mop tub.

Cons:
1) The mop’s thread material is quite delicate. After the first wash, at least three strands came out, and a few more falls off with each use. And will continue for sure, I know.

Overall, I’m still using it. It’s average but functional for daily use.

Rushwak Bathroom Cleaning Brush with Wiper Upgraded 3 in 1 Toilet Brush Bathroom Brush with Long Handle 180° Rotate Bathroom Floor Cleaning Brush Bathroom Cleaning Accessories (Multicolor),5.0 out of 5 stars,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I recently purchased the bathroom cleaning brush with a wiper, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way possible! This product is a game-changer when it comes to keeping my bathroom spotless and gleaming.

First and foremost, the quality of this brush is outstanding. The bristles are sturdy and durable, ensuring they don't wear out quickly even with regular use. The handle is comfortable to grip, and the overall construction feels solid and well-made. I can tell that this brush is built to last, which makes it a fantastic investment for my cleaning arsenal.

The wiper feature is what truly sets this bathroom brush apart from others on the market. It's incredibly handy for wiping away excess water and cleaning solution, leaving my bathroom surfaces completely dry and streak-free. This saves me a lot of time and effort, as I don't have to reach for a separate cloth or paper towel to wipe down surfaces after scrubbing.

Cleaning with this brush is a breeze. The bristles do an excellent job of tackling tough stains and grime without scratching or damaging my bathroom fixtures. Plus, the wiper efficiently collects the residue, making the whole process more efficient and thorough.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with the bathroom cleaning brush with a wiper. Its impressive quality, efficient cleaning power, and convenient design have made my cleaning routine much more enjoyable. If you're looking for a top-notch bathroom cleaning tool, I highly recommend giving this brush a try. You won't be disappointed!

The video quality is too good and the setup is very easy. But the product needs lot of improvements which I am listing out below.
1. The tilt option is not that great and you can't focus the floor and door at the same time if it is installed above 5 feet high.
2. The 2 way talk option is just for name sake. The speaker quality is one of the worst one could imagine. You literally need to keep your ears in the camera to hear what the other one speaks.
3. Sound notifications and motion notifications are annoying which made me to disable them. Sound of crows and dogs far from home are detected (which happens all the time) and sends notifications. Similarly screen movements are sent as motion detection notifications. Detection of Human voice and motion alone could have been helpful and solved the real need.
4. Onvif never works. It asks for Password reset but if I select that nothing happens but freezing.
5. Smart controls seems not working. I have scheduled things for eg. Switch on the recording when it is 8am. But it never started to record.
6. Also there is no option to automate recording like Stop recording from Night 8 to Morning 8 every day.
7. Option to view in PC is too naive. If I wanted to view the feeds from office (or other phone restricted place), I can't do that as I need to scan the QR shown by the webpage through the mobile app. Even then it hardly works/opens.

Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reasonable pricing and of the correct size for cleaning purposes. Easy to use and very practical.,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a reliable and effective cleaning solution that effortlessly balances form and function. With a sturdy build and thoughtful design, these sponges prove to be a versatile companion in tackling various cleaning tasks around the house.

The pack's inclusion of six sponges ensures an extended period of use, making it a cost-effective option for those who require a long-lasting cleaning tool. The dual-sided design, featuring a scrubbing side and a softer wiping side, offers the flexibility needed to address both stubborn stains and delicate surfaces. This adaptability proves especially handy in the kitchen, where grime and grease are common adversaries.

One of the standout features of these sponges is their durability. The scrubbing side effectively removes tough residue without wearing down too quickly, while the wiping side maintains its integrity through multiple uses. This robustness translates into fewer replacements and less waste, contributing to a more sustainable cleaning routine.

While the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge pack delivers on its promises, there is room for slight improvement. The scrubbing surface, while effective, may feel abrasive on more delicate items. Additionally, a greater variety of colors or patterns could add a touch of visual appeal to the utilitarian design.

In conclusion, the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a dependable and practical cleaning tool that shines in its ability to adapt to different cleaning challenges. Its longevity, dual-sided functionality, and overall durability make it a solid investment for anyone seeking a reliable cleaning companion. While some refinements could enhance its aesthetic appeal, its performance remains the true highlight. Say goodbye to stubborn stains and embrace the convenience of these scrub sponges in your cleaning arsenal.

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this product in May-2024, total 3 nos for my different bathroom showers. After almost 3 months of usage. I'm forced to post this review. So everything was fine till date. Even the filter was doing a good job. The problem comes when u want to replace the cartridge or u want to change the position of the cartridge. So 1st time I changed the direction of cartridge from the filter upside down. This is required to be done as per the company's instruction. It took hell lot of ime to do this job..I don't know why they have made this filter and cartridge assembly in such a bad design that u cannot remove the cartridge from the filter. I did this anyhow and second time I tried this today with another filter but the cartridge is not getting separated whatever I tried. If the manufacturer wanted to sell cartridge as a replacement or consumable item then it should have been user friendly. Even entire cartridge got damaged but it didn't come out. I am had Even purchased extra cartridge for this filter..it's a waste for me now..I don't know any other person faced the same problems but this is the worst design i must say. Again the filter is expensive around 2k..u cannot waste this much money for 3-4 months usage.i would request water science team to see this and help me out,Pranav Kankee

Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product to use for once and all. It is for day to day normal use and for normal stain utensils. Thank you.,S.S.
Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),4.0 out of 5 stars,Have always been purchasing the original scotch brite pads since they don't leave behind residue on the plates which we then inevitably digest while eating off plates. Because, let's face it, how much ever we wash the plates, there is always micro-residue from the cheap ripped off scrub pads in the market. The Scotch Brite scrub pads don't degrade like their cheap counterparts and hence last longer.
Price could be cheaper but then this is a premium product with the 3M logo. Gotta pay for the brand and the quality.,su-personic

Because, let's face it, how much ever we wash the plates, there is always micro-residue from the cheap ripped off scrub pads in the market. The Scotch Brite scrub pads don't degrade like their cheap counterparts and hence last longer.
Price could be cheaper but then this is a premium product with the 3M logo. Gotta pay for the brand and the quality.,su-personic

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this bottle cleaner. This is the second one I have ordered. I have kept one each at my home and my in law's place. It does the job. It does reach the bottom corners of the bottles as claimed. Overall a good one. I use it mostly for the kids bottles. It has a good reach. It dries quickly once you shake off as much water as you can.
The sponge is detachable from the handle as mentioned in the product description, to enable it to be changed once the sponge weras out. Now I haven't checked if the sponge head is available separately. Otherwise this is a bit expensive.,Mom to an autistic kid.
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,The scrubber given is very good and it cleans the milk residue properly , the only issue is that the handle detaches and the scrubber stays the bottle which is very hard to remove,Udayani
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),3.0 out of 5 stars,Suitable for bottles with slightly bigger mouths; though not meant for heavy use, if head gets stuck inside any bottle, its sponge part can come off the handle!,Ajay
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely wonderful product. Exactly what i needed. Perfect cleaning.

Another review mentioned, the scrub coming off if bottle mouth is small... it is a hassle but not a hig one. Having a removable facility ensures that the scrub can be cleaned throughly. So, it is good feature.,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),1.0 out of 5 stars,3rd class quality. Unable to clean the bottles easily. Foam and handle got seperated during cleaning making the cleaning uncomfortable and ineffective. Worst brush,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this bottle cleaner for cleaning steel water bottle. I was facing issue with local brushes where the sponge on the lower part of the brush would get off quickly creating issues in cleaning the bottom of the bottle from inside. Did purchase this product with the hopes that it would solve this issue and the product delivered true to my expectations.

The only downside I see is that if the mouth of the bottle is a bit smaller, there can be issues in getting the brush outside without the risk of cleaning brush stuck inside the bottle.,Shantanu
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,Getting the perfect bottle cleaning brush is a hard task for Mommies. This one does the job well but as the scrubber is loosely attached to the handle..it often comes out while pulling away from smaller bottles.

I suggest Team Scotch Brite to make a smaller one of this for kids feeding bottles.,Aprajita Mishra

Night vision: very good
Wireless connectivity: good

Notification: very good
Feature: All required features are available.
Bad: when to talk, camera sound quality need to improve. Meaning camera sound system need to improve. But sound captured by camre is very good.
Alarm: good,Rajdeep Sen
Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,4.0 out of 5 stars,Updating my review after one month of use. No change in my rating and just updating more prons and cons

Pros
1. Good indoor camera for normal use.
2. Configuring is easy
3.Tapo app is responsive and working good
4. Video Clarity is ok
5. Sound is ok
6. Rotation is smooth , but a very small sound while rotating. A person who is standing near to camera can notice this sound
7. Zooming is ok , but no optical zoom
8. Night vision is good
9. You can add presets and presets are working good. I am specifically telling this because presets won't work well in some other brand cameraz . But for tapo it is working very good.

10. You can adjust rotation angle and it is one of the feature missing in other camera.

11. Person detection is working well and you can easily differtiate normal motion detection with person detection by a person symbol on thumbnails.

Cons
1. Cloud storage is expensive
2. No optical zoom, only digital zoom. I didn't like zoom clarity compared to other 3mp models. If you want to zoom a large distance , don't take this.i own an ezviz 1k camera and i liked zoom clarity of that than this.
3. Can't control the siren as per our will.siren works only in motion detection. So if a small insect is flying , then it will make sound. But we can restrict it to human detection. I always prefer an alarm with a button which we can trigger from app.
4. Play back or recorded video in memory card fast-forward option is not via slider. You can select a speed and it will fast forward based on that. But I always prefer a slider for fast-forward.

5. Tapo is autorotating sometimes. Not sure why . I don't want this feature.
6. One major con I noticed is the wifi network updation . Most of the cameras now a days allow you to change wifi network via app . But for tapo we can't change wifi via app. I can see network selection is ready only field and no action on that.

It looked both too easy to be of use, and too complicated to actually set up and use. I couldn't have been more wrong. This TP-Link Tapo security camera is just what I needed. I bought one to try and see, and the minute it was set up and I could see what it could do, Immediately ordered three more. It is an easy setup task, and the benefits of having them are so much more than I would have expected. They are also more affordable than I expected. I now have one in each of my main rooms, and I can see what's happening in my house from the office desk. I have yet to try to access my house through the camera from another country, but I have no doubt that it would work. I use it to make sure my pets are OK. The camera pans, tilts, has night vision, records, has a privacy mode, can be wall mounted or free standing, and I can talk through the camera, which will be a weight off my mind when I have to go abroad and need to see if my pet sitter is actually doing what has been asked of them. If I can feel like this about my pets, I can imagine how a parent might feel to be able to watch their children through them! I recommend these cameras with no hesitation. Just FYI - there is an option to sign up for a monthly payable cloud storage system for these cameras. But if you are not keen to do that, you have to buy a storage card to record what you need. (There is an option to turn on the privacy mode which means the cameras will only record if the privacy mode is switched off.)

We were out of town for few days and this camera is suppose to monitor the house, but unfortunately it worked for only two days. WiFi was working fine other cameras from Philips was doing their job. But this Tapo camera went offline and did nothing for rest of the time. I have enabled the auto restart setting on daily intervals, but I believe that didn’t work. Tried to reach out customer care, but they will not respond, and since the product is working fine and issue is intermittent, was not able to show to the customer care. Think before you buy. Go with Philips cameras as they support offline recordings, though they are bit costly.,shreyas

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cette caméra est un excellent choix pour ceux qui recherchent une solution de surveillance domestique efficace et abordable. Avec sa résolution 2K, la qualité d’image est impressionnante, offrant des vidéos nettes et claires, ce qui permet de capturer les moindres détails, même dans des conditions de faible luminosité. L’angle de vision de 360° et la possibilité de faire pivoter la caméra à distance via l’application Tapo ajoutent une flexibilité appréciable, permettant de couvrir une large zone avec un seul appareil.

L’installation est simple et rapide, même pour les moins technophiles. L’application Tapo est intuitive, rendant le contrôle de la caméra et l’accès aux vidéos enregistrées très faciles. De plus, la fonctionnalité de détection de mouvement et les notifications en temps réel sont très utiles pour rester informé de ce qui se passe chez soi.

Cependant, il y a quelques points à améliorer. Par exemple, la caméra nécessite une connexion Wi-Fi stable pour fonctionner de manière optimale, ce qui peut être un problème si le signal est faible. De plus, bien que la caméra soit livrée avec un emplacement pour carte microSD, le stockage en ligne est payant, ce qui peut représenter un coût supplémentaire à long terme.

En dépit de ces petits inconvénients, la Tapo 2K C210 reste un excellent rapport qualité-prix et je la recommande sans hésitation pour sécuriser votre domicile.

-Telefon ile uzaktan bağlanarak kamerayı hareket ettirme
-Telefon ile uzaktan karşılıklı konuşma
-Telefon ile uzaktan bağlanarak sd kartta kayıtlı dosyaları telefona indirme
-Kameranın hareket takibi ve telefona anlık bildirim göndermesi
-Telefona kısayol ekleyip evden çıkarken basıyorsunuz kamera çalışmaya başlıyor eve geldiğinizde eve geldim kısayoluna basıyorsunuz ve kamera ev moduna geçiyor.

Gerçekten çok güzel bir cihaz. Görüntü kalitesi ve cihaz kalitesi gayet iyi.

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cette caméra est un excellent choix pour ceux qui recherchent une solution de surveillance domestique efficace et abordable. Avec sa résolution 2K, la qualité d’image est impressionnante, offrant des vidéos nettes et claires, ce qui permet de capturer les moindres détails, même dans des conditions de faible luminosité. L’angle de vision de 360° et la possibilité de faire pivoter la caméra à distance via l’application Tapo ajoutent une flexibilité appréciable, permettant de couvrir une large zone avec un seul appareil.

L’installation est simple et rapide, même pour les moins technophiles. L’application Tapo est intuitive, rendant le contrôle de la caméra et l’accès aux vidéos enregistrées très faciles. De plus, la fonctionnalité de détection de mouvement et les notifications en temps réel sont très utiles pour rester informé de ce qui se passe chez soi.

Cependant, il y a quelques points à améliorer. Par exemple, la caméra nécessite une connexion Wi-Fi stable pour fonctionner de manière optimale, ce qui peut être un problème si le signal est faible. De plus, bien que la caméra soit livrée avec un emplacement pour carte microSD, le stockage en ligne est payant, ce qui peut représenter un coût supplémentaire à long terme.

En dépit de ces petits inconvénients, la Tapo 2K C210 reste un excellent rapport qualité-prix et je la recommande sans hésitation pour sécuriser votre domicile.

Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),3.0 out of 5 stars,The base is not stable by design. It swivels uncontrollably, and will fold over while scrubbing. So it is not possible to scrub without interruptions.

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s been about 4 days since I got this product and I’m happy with it as a baby monitor so far. It was easy to set up. As it can rest on any flat surface, I didn’t need to install it anywhere but it comes with all the necessary accessories for a wall mount. But because of the flat design I can put it anywhere near my baby, and even if I move her to another room, I can take the camera with me. The 360° rotation is impressive and the video quality is great, especially since I use it on the phone mostly—even 480p is sufficient.

The best features are the sound and movement triggers. If my little one wakes up annd moves around and/or cries, notifications are sent to my phone and the feed is also recorded for that portion (in case you want to check what disturbed them). This is great if you need to be in another room—gives you peace of mind. In fact, the sound trigger feature is not available in other cameras in this price range so this was the main deciding factor for my choice. The live feed is definitely a boon to make sure baby is fine when you’re away from her. You can also zoom in on the live feed, which is a cool little feature that I was not expecting. Plus, with the recording feature, you get to have little memories of the baby waking up saved away for the future :)

The only feature I’ve not had a chance to test is night vision but some videos of this camera I saw on YouTube seem to show that this feature is solid in the camera.

Right now I’m on the Imou Life trial subscription because it’s free and will save all recordings to the cloud (up to 3 days). I’ll move to a micro SD soon though. Thinking of also getting a power bank to make it truly portable. Overall, this device is great value and I’d recommend it for parents looking for a baby monitor.

I am using it since 2 years and the performance is still decent. It has decent night vision and quality. It rotates 360° horizontally and 270° vertically. You can use sd card or buy their subscription for storage which I will talk about later. But!!! The most annoying thingಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ!!! Is actually it's software (⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)(⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)!!! I should write this thing in app's review but I think it should be added in product review too as it shows your experience using the product. So the first and major problem is that the app logs out every 3-4 days you don't use it which is very annoying. Imagine there is an emergency at your home and you need to turn on the camera ASAP, you open the app and boom!! Throw your emergency away and login here(⁠◠⁠ω◕⁠)!!
Also trust me, it is veryyy like very complicated and hard to login. The other issue is bro why do you even sell you products in India if you don't want to accept India's payment options. You can't use UPI apps it tells you to use paypal, bro seriously how the hell am I supposed to use paypal here or else use international cards :D!! And don't just use international cards but you have to buy the monthly subscription and trust me again it is very hard to cancel the subscription. I only need the camera twice or thrice a year so why should I waste my money in buying the subscription every month!?!??
Well this is my review it ends here.

TNT THE NEXT TREND Ladder for Home use Heavy Duty Steel with Wide Steps and Top Platform with Anti Slip and Anti Skid Shoes can be Used as Step Stool in Office and Industrial Purpose (Black) (3 Step),1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this 2-step ladder with the expectation of it being sturdy, especially given the company’s claim that it can handle up to 150 kg. However, after just six months of light, home use by individuals weighing around 70-80 kg, one of the foot steps cracked, making it unsafe to use. This is disappointing for a product advertised as durable and capable of supporting much heavier weights. The quality feels subpar, and it’s clear the ladder isn’t built to withstand regular use.

It would have been beneficial if the instructions also covered setting the date and time, but I managed to navigate it by referring to their instructional YouTube video.

Upon opening the safe, I noticed it was disappointingly dirty. It's essential for the dispatch team to ensure cleanliness by removing paint, dust, and other debris before shipping the product. The carpet in the lower slot, while present, is inadequately glued and doesn't fit properly. Furthermore, the carpet piece's size does not match the dimensions, resulting in unsightly folds. The key is flimsy and seems generic, I am worried that any one with similar key can open the locker which totally defies the purpose of having the locker at first place.

The outer body of the safe is robust and well-constructed, seemingly made in India. However, my concern lies with the locking mechanism, which is made in China and appears flimsy. Only time will reveal the true durability of the safe. Additionally, the product seems slightly overpriced compared to competitors such as Amazon Basics safe lockers.

Despite these drawbacks, I recommend the product based on its overall performance and construction.

Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL (Modular,1 Piece),5.0 out of 5 stars,Firstly, the modular design of this broom is very convenient. It comes in 1 piece, making it easy to assemble and use. The handle is also adjustable, which is perfect for someone like me who is on the shorter side. I can adjust the handle to my desired length for comfortable sweeping. One of the main features that drew me to this broom was the promise of no dust. I have always struggled with traditional brooms leaving behind a trail of dust and debris. However, the Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL lives up to its name. The bristles are made of soft, fine fibers that effectively pick up all the dust and dirt without scattering it around. This has made sweeping a much cleaner and less messy task. Another great feature of this broom is its XL size. The broom head is wider than most traditional brooms, which means I can cover more surface area with each sweep. This has significantly reduced my cleaning time. The broom is also lightweight, making it easy to maneuver around furniture and corners. The quality of this broom is top-notch. The bristles are strong and durable, and they have not shown any signs of wear and tear even after multiple uses. The handle is also sturdy and feels comfortable to hold.,One Malabar Hill

Scotch-Brite Plastic Spin Mop Head and Handle (Suitable for Scotch-Brite 2 in 1 Spin Mop Only),3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this mop from Scotch Brite because I was frustrated with the Prestige ones, many of which now seem to be fake copies. Although this one is a bit pricey, it’s been working well after several months of use.

Pros:
1) The spin mechanism is effective; it dries quickly after just two spins.
2) The mopping material is decent and gets the job done, although it mops in patches due to the design.
3) It’s very easy to assemble.
4) You can buy just the mop stick alone if you already have a mop tub.

Cons:
1) The mop’s thread material is quite delicate. After the first wash, at least three strands came out, and a few more falls off with each use. And will continue for sure, I know.

Overall, I’m still using it. It’s average but functional for daily use.

Rushwak Bathroom Cleaning Brush with Wiper Upgraded 3 in 1 Toilet Brush Bathroom Brush with Long Handle 180° Rotate Bathroom Floor Cleaning Brush Bathroom Cleaning Accessories (Multicolor),5.0 out of 5 stars,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I recently purchased the bathroom cleaning brush with a wiper, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way possible! This product is a game-changer when it comes to keeping my bathroom spotless and gleaming.

First and foremost, the quality of this brush is outstanding. The bristles are sturdy and durable, ensuring they don't wear out quickly even with regular use. The handle is comfortable to grip, and the overall construction feels solid and well-made. I can tell that this brush is built to last, which makes it a fantastic investment for my cleaning arsenal.

The wiper feature is what truly sets this bathroom brush apart from others on the market. It's incredibly handy for wiping away excess water and cleaning solution, leaving my bathroom surfaces completely dry and streak-free. This saves me a lot of time and effort, as I don't have to reach for a separate cloth or paper towel to wipe down surfaces after scrubbing.

Cleaning with this brush is a breeze. The bristles do an excellent job of tackling tough stains and grime without scratching or damaging my bathroom fixtures. Plus, the wiper efficiently collects the residue, making the whole process more efficient and thorough.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with the bathroom cleaning brush with a wiper. Its impressive quality, efficient cleaning power, and convenient design have made my cleaning routine much more enjoyable. If you're looking for a top-notch bathroom cleaning tool, I highly recommend giving this brush a try. You won't be disappointed!

The video quality is too good and the setup is very easy. But the product needs lot of improvements which I am listing out below.
1. The tilt option is not that great and you can't focus the floor and door at the same time if it is installed above 5 feet high.
2. The 2 way talk option is just for name sake. The speaker quality is one of the worst one could imagine. You literally need to keep your ears in the camera to hear what the other one speaks.
3. Sound notifications and motion notifications are annoying which made me to disable them. Sound of crows and dogs far from home are detected (which happens all the time) and sends notifications. Similarly screen movements are sent as motion detection notifications. Detection of Human voice and motion alone could have been helpful and solved the real need.
4. Onvif never works. It asks for Password reset but if I select that nothing happens but freezing.
5. Smart controls seems not working. I have scheduled things for eg. Switch on the recording when it is 8am. But it never started to record.
6. Also there is no option to automate recording like Stop recording from Night 8 to Morning 8 every day.
7. Option to view in PC is too naive. If I wanted to view the feeds from office (or other phone restricted place), I can't do that as I need to scan the QR shown by the webpage through the mobile app. Even then it hardly works/opens.

Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a reliable and effective cleaning solution that effortlessly balances form and function. With a sturdy build and thoughtful design, these sponges prove to be a versatile companion in tackling various cleaning tasks around the house.

The pack's inclusion of six sponges ensures an extended period of use, making it a cost-effective option for those who require a long-lasting cleaning tool. The dual-sided design, featuring a scrubbing side and a softer wiping side, offers the flexibility needed to address both stubborn stains and delicate surfaces. This adaptability proves especially handy in the kitchen, where grime and grease are common adversaries.

One of the standout features of these sponges is their durability. The scrubbing side effectively removes tough residue without wearing down too quickly, while the wiping side maintains its integrity through multiple uses. This robustness translates into fewer replacements and less waste, contributing to a more sustainable cleaning routine.

While the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge pack delivers on its promises, there is room for slight improvement. The scrubbing surface, while effective, may feel abrasive on more delicate items. Additionally, a greater variety of colors or patterns could add a touch of visual appeal to the utilitarian design.

In conclusion, the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a dependable and practical cleaning tool that shines in its ability to adapt to different cleaning challenges. Its longevity, dual-sided functionality, and overall durability make it a solid investment for anyone seeking a reliable cleaning companion. While some refinements could enhance its aesthetic appeal, its performance remains the true highlight. Say goodbye to stubborn stains and embrace the convenience of these scrub sponges in your cleaning arsenal.

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this product in May-2024, total 3 nos for my different bathroom showers. After almost 3 months of usage. I'm forced to post this review. So everything was fine till date. Even the filter was doing a good job. The problem comes when u want to replace the cartridge or u want to change the position of the cartridge. So 1st time I changed the direction of cartridge from the filter upside down. This is required to be done as per the company's instruction. It took hell lot of ime to do this job..I don't know why they have made this filter and cartridge assembly in such a bad design that u cannot remove the cartridge from the filter. I did this anyhow and second time I tried this today with another filter but the cartridge is not getting separated whatever I tried. If the manufacturer wanted to sell cartridge as a replacement or consumable item then it should have been user friendly. Even entire cartridge got damaged but it didn't come out. I am had Even purchased extra cartridge for this filter..it's a waste for me now..I don't know any other person faced the same problems but this is the worst design i must say. Again the filter is expensive around 2k..u cannot waste this much money for 3-4 months usage.i would request water science team to see this and help me out,Pranav Kankee

Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product to use for once and all. It is for day to day normal use and for normal stain utensils. Thank you.,S.S.
Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),4.0 out of 5 stars,Have always been purchasing the original scotch brite pads since they don't leave behind residue on the plates which we then inevitably digest while eating off plates. Because, let's face it, how much ever we wash the plates, there is always micro-residue from the cheap ripped off scrub pads in the market. The Scotch Brite scrub pads don't degrade like their cheap counterparts and hence last longer.

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this bottle cleaner. This is the second one I have ordered. I have kept one each at my home and my in law's place. It does the job. It does reach the bottom corners of the bottles as claimed. Overall a good one. I use it mostly for the kids bottles. It has a good reach. It dries quickly once you shake off as much water as you can.
The sponge is detachable from the handle as mentioned in the product description, to enable it to be changed once the sponge weras out. Now I haven't checked if the sponge head is available separately. Otherwise this is a bit expensive.,Mom to an autistic kid.
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,The scrubber given is very good and it cleans the milk residue properly , the only issue is that the handle detaches and the scrubber stays the bottle which is very hard to remove,Udayani
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),3.0 out of 5 stars,Suitable for bottles with slightly bigger mouths; though not meant for heavy use, if head gets stuck inside any bottle, its sponge part can come off the handle!,Ajay
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely wonderful product. Exactly what i needed. Perfect cleaning.

Another review mentioned, the scrub coming off if bottle mouth is small... it is a hassle but not a hig one. Having a removable facility ensures that the scrub can be cleaned throughly. So, it is good feature.,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),1.0 out of 5 stars,3rd class quality. Unable to clean the bottles easily. Foam and handle got seperated during cleaning making the cleaning uncomfortable and ineffective. Worst brush,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this bottle cleaner for cleaning steel water bottle. I was facing issue with local brushes where the sponge on the lower part of the brush would get off quickly creating issues in cleaning the bottom of the bottle from inside. Did purchase this product with the hopes that it would solve this issue and the product delivered true to my expectations.

The only downside I see is that if the mouth of the bottle is a bit smaller, there can be issues in getting the brush outside without the risk of cleaning brush stuck inside the bottle.,Shantanu
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,Getting the perfect bottle cleaning brush is a hard task for Mommies. This one does the job well but as the scrubber is loosely attached to the handle..it often comes out while pulling away from smaller bottles.

I suggest Team Scotch Brite to make a smaller one of this for kids feeding bottles.,Aprajita Mishra

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure how long this will last but it is stronger than the usual "bottle brush" as it is made from foam rasher than "brush material"

Works well - just a pity I had to buy two!!!,Peter D. G. Raven
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this bottle cleaner. This is the second one I have ordered. I have kept one each at my home and my in law's place. It does the job. It does reach the bottom corners of the bottles as claimed. Overall a good one. I use it mostly for the kids bottles. It has a good reach. It dries quickly once you shake off as much water as you can.
The sponge is detachable from the handle as mentioned in the product description, to enable it to be changed once the sponge weras out. Now I haven't checked if the sponge head is available separately. Otherwise this is a bit expensive.,Mom to an autistic kid.

Night vision: very good
Wireless connectivity: good
Detection: very good.
Notification: very good
Feature: All required features are available.
Bad: when to talk, camera sound quality need to improve. Meaning camera sound system need to improve. But sound captured by camre is very good.
Alarm: good,Rajdeep Sen
Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,4.0 out of 5 stars,Updating my review after one month of use. No change in my rating and just updating more prons and cons

Pros
1. Good indoor camera for normal use.
2. Configuring is easy
3.Tapo app is responsive and working good
4. Video Clarity is ok
5. Sound is ok
6. Rotation is smooth , but a very small sound while rotating. A person who is standing near to camera can notice this sound
7. Zooming is ok , but no optical zoom
8. Night vision is good
9. You can add presets and presets are working good. I am specifically telling this because presets won't work well in some other brand cameraz . But for tapo it is working very good.

10. You can adjust rotation angle and it is one of the feature missing in other camera.

11. Person detection is working well and you can easily differtiate normal motion detection with person detection by a person symbol on thumbnails.

Cons
1. Cloud storage is expensive
2. No optical zoom, only digital zoom. I didn't like zoom clarity compared to other 3mp models. If you want to zoom a large distance , don't take this.i own an ezviz 1k camera and i liked zoom clarity of that than this.
3. Can't control the siren as per our will.siren works only in motion detection. So if a small insect is flying , then it will make sound. But we can restrict it to human detection. I always prefer an alarm with a button which we can trigger from app.
4. Play back or recorded video in memory card fast-forward option is not via slider. You can select a speed and it will fast forward based on that. But I always prefer a slider for fast-forward.

5. Tapo is autorotating sometimes. Not sure why . I don't want this feature.
6. One major con I noticed is the wifi network updation . Most of the cameras now a days allow you to change wifi network via app . But for tapo we can't change wifi via app. I can see network selection is ready only field and no action on that.

It looked both too easy to be of use, and too complicated to actually set up and use. I couldn't have been more wrong. This TP-Link Tapo security camera is just what I needed. I bought one to try and see, and the minute it was set up and I could see what it could do, Immediately ordered three more. It is an easy setup task, and the benefits of having them are so much more than I would have expected. They are also more affordable than I expected. I now have one in each of my main rooms, and I can see what's happening in my house from the office desk. I have yet to try to access my house through the camera from another country, but I have no doubt that it would work. I use it to make sure my pets are OK. The camera pans, tilts, has night vision, records, has a privacy mode, can be wall mounted or free standing, and I can talk through the camera, which will be a weight off my mind when I have to go abroad and need to see if my pet sitter is actually doing what has been asked of them. If I can feel like this about my pets, I can imagine how a parent might feel to be able to watch their children through them! I recommend these cameras with no hesitation. Just FYI - there is an option to sign up for a monthly payable cloud storage system for these cameras. But if you are not keen to do that, you have to buy a storage card to record what you need. (There is an option to turn on the privacy mode which means the cameras will only record if the privacy mode is switched off.)

We were out of town for few days and this camera is suppose to monitor the house, but unfortunately it worked for only two days. WiFi was working fine other cameras from Philips was doing their job. But this Tapo camera went offline and did nothing for rest of the time. I have enabled the auto restart setting on daily intervals, but I believe that didn’t work. Tried to reach out customer care, but they will not respond, and since the product is working fine and issue is intermittent, was not able to show to the customer care. Think before you buy. Go with Philips cameras as they support offline recordings, though they are bit costly.,shreyas

Avec sa résolution 2K, la qualité d’image est impressionnante, offrant des vidéos nettes et claires, ce qui permet de capturer les moindres détails, même dans des conditions de faible luminosité. L’angle de vision de 360° et la possibilité de faire pivoter la caméra à distance via l’application Tapo ajoutent une flexibilité appréciable, permettant de couvrir une large zone avec un seul appareil.

L’installation est simple et rapide, même pour les moins technophiles. L’application Tapo est intuitive, rendant le contrôle de la caméra et l’accès aux vidéos enregistrées très faciles. De plus, la fonctionnalité de détection de mouvement et les notifications en temps réel sont très utiles pour rester informé de ce qui se passe chez soi.

Cependant, il y a quelques points à améliorer. Par exemple, la caméra nécessite une connexion Wi-Fi stable pour fonctionner de manière optimale, ce qui peut être un problème si le signal est faible. De plus, bien que la caméra soit livrée avec un emplacement pour carte microSD, le stockage en ligne est payant, ce qui peut représenter un coût supplémentaire à long terme.

En dépit de ces petits inconvénients, la Tapo 2K C210 reste un excellent rapport qualité-prix et je la recommande sans hésitation pour sécuriser votre domicile.

Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),3.0 out of 5 stars,The base is not stable by design. It swivels uncontrollably, and will fold over while scrubbing. So it is not possible to scrub without interruptions.

The materials are somewhat sturdy and won't break.

So 3 stars for that. 2 stars less for usability.,ReviewerX

Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),1.0 out of 5 stars,This product could have been so much more. It has the brush, it has the stand, and it has the mobility. However, because you cannot keep it in a static position, it simply pivots whenever pressure it applied. Because of this "feature," you cannot clean anything with sufficient amounts of force.

The idea is good. But the execution is lacking. Avoid!,Sunny

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s been about 4 days since I got this product and I’m happy with it as a baby monitor so far. It was easy to set up. As it can rest on any flat surface, I didn’t need to install it anywhere but it comes with all the necessary accessories for a wall mount. But because of the flat design I can put it anywhere near my baby, and even if I move her to another room, I can take the camera with me. The 360° rotation is impressive and the video quality is great, especially since I use it on the phone mostly—even 480p is sufficient.

The best features are the sound and movement triggers. If my little one wakes up annd moves around and/or cries, notifications are sent to my phone and the feed is also recorded for that portion (in case you want to check what disturbed them). This is great if you need to be in another room—gives you peace of mind. In fact, the sound trigger feature is not available in other cameras in this price range so this was the main deciding factor for my choice. The live feed is definitely a boon to make sure baby is fine when you’re away from her. You can also zoom in on the live feed, which is a cool little feature that I was not expecting. Plus, with the recording feature, you get to have little memories of the baby waking up saved away for the future :)

The only feature I’ve not had a chance to test is night vision but some videos of this camera I saw on YouTube seem to show that this feature is solid in the camera.

Right now I’m on the Imou Life trial subscription because it’s free and will save all recordings to the cloud (up to 3 days). I’ll move to a micro SD soon though. Thinking of also getting a power bank to make it truly portable. Overall, this device is great value and I’d recommend it for parents looking for a baby monitor.

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,3.0 out of 5 stars,The camera is really good. I am using it since 2 years and the performance is still decent. It has decent night vision and quality. It rotates 360° horizontally and 270° vertically. You can use sd card or buy their subscription for storage which I will talk about later. But!!! The most annoying thingಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ!!! Is actually it's software (⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)(⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)!!! I should write this thing in app's review but I think it should be added in product review too as it shows your experience using the product. So the first and major problem is that the app logs out every 3-4 days you don't use it which is very annoying. Imagine there is an emergency at your home and you need to turn on the camera ASAP, you open the app and boom!! Throw your emergency away and login here(⁠◠⁠ω◕⁠)!!
Also trust me, it is veryyy like very complicated and hard to login. The other issue is bro why do you even sell you products in India if you don't want to accept India's payment options. You can't use UPI apps it tells you to use paypal, bro seriously how the hell am I supposed to use paypal here or else use international cards :D!! And don't just use international cards but you have to buy the monthly subscription and trust me again it is very hard to cancel the subscription. I only need the camera twice or thrice a year so why should I waste my money in buying the subscription every month!?!??
Well this is my review it ends here.

TNT THE NEXT TREND Ladder for Home use Heavy Duty Steel with Wide Steps and Top Platform with Anti Slip and Anti Skid Shoes can be Used as Step Stool in Office and Industrial Purpose (Black) (3 Step),1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this 2-step ladder with the expectation of it being sturdy, especially given the company’s claim that it can handle up to 150 kg. However, after just six months of light, home use by individuals weighing around 70-80 kg, one of the foot steps cracked, making it unsafe to use. This is disappointing for a product advertised as durable and capable of supporting much heavier weights. The quality feels subpar, and it’s clear the ladder isn’t built to withstand regular use. I wouldn’t recommend this product if you're looking for something reliable and long-lasting.,mani

Ozone Safe Locker for Home | Digital Lock | Safety Locker For Home | Non Motorized | Master & User PIN Code Access | Tijori Locker | Black | 16 Litres | 24 Months Warranty By Ozone (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,The secure locker arrived packaged in the branded box, cushioned on both sides with safety pads. However, the box lacked a proper seal, featuring only a simple cello tape adorned with the brand name. Setting up the safe proved to be straightforward, thanks to the provided instructions. It would have been beneficial if the instructions also covered setting the date and time, but I managed to navigate it by referring to their instructional YouTube video.

Upon opening the safe, I noticed it was disappointingly dirty. It's essential for the dispatch team to ensure cleanliness by removing paint, dust, and other debris before shipping the product. The carpet in the lower slot, while present, is inadequately glued and doesn't fit properly. Furthermore, the carpet piece's size does not match the dimensions, resulting in unsightly folds. The key is flimsy and seems generic, I am worried that any one with similar key can open the locker which totally defies the purpose of having the locker at first place.

The outer body of the safe is robust and well-constructed, seemingly made in India. However, my concern lies with the locking mechanism, which is made in China and appears flimsy. Only time will reveal the true durability of the safe. Additionally, the product seems slightly overpriced compared to competitors such as Amazon Basics safe lockers.

Despite these drawbacks, I recommend the product based on its overall performance and construction.

Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL (Modular,1 Piece),5.0 out of 5 stars,Firstly, the modular design of this broom is very convenient. It comes in 1 piece, making it easy to assemble and use. The handle is also adjustable, which is perfect for someone like me who is on the shorter side. I can adjust the handle to my desired length for comfortable sweeping. One of the main features that drew me to this broom was the promise of no dust. I have always struggled with traditional brooms leaving behind a trail of dust and debris. However, the Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL lives up to its name. The bristles are made of soft, fine fibers that effectively pick up all the dust and dirt without scattering it around. This has made sweeping a much cleaner and less messy task. Another great feature of this broom is its XL size. The broom head is wider than most traditional brooms, which means I can cover more surface area with each sweep. This has significantly reduced my cleaning time. The broom is also lightweight, making it easy to maneuver around furniture and corners. The quality of this broom is top-notch. The bristles are strong and durable, and they have not shown any signs of wear and tear even after multiple uses. The handle is also sturdy and feels comfortable to hold.,One Malabar Hill

Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL (Modular,1 Piece),5.0 out of 5 stars,Firstly, the modular design of this broom is very convenient. It comes in 1 piece, making it easy to assemble and use. The handle is also adjustable, which is perfect for someone like me who is on the shorter side. I can adjust the handle to my desired length for comfortable sweeping. One of the main features that drew me to this broom was the promise of no dust. I have always struggled with traditional brooms leaving behind a trail of dust and debris. However, the Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL lives up to its name. The bristles are made of soft, fine fibers that effectively pick up all the dust and dirt without scattering it around. This has made sweeping a much cleaner and less messy task. Another great feature of this broom is its XL size. The broom head is wider than most traditional brooms, which means I can cover more surface area with each sweep. This has significantly reduced my cleaning time. The broom is also lightweight, making it easy to maneuver around furniture and corners. The quality of this broom is top-notch. The bristles are strong and durable, and they have not shown any signs of wear and tear even after multiple uses. The handle is also sturdy and feels comfortable to hold.,One Malabar Hill

Scotch-Brite Plastic Spin Mop Head and Handle (Suitable for Scotch-Brite 2 in 1 Spin Mop Only),3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this mop from Scotch Brite because I was frustrated with the Prestige ones, many of which now seem to be fake copies. Although this one is a bit pricey, it’s been working well after several months of use.

Pros:
1) The spin mechanism is effective; it dries quickly after just two spins.
2) The mopping material is decent and gets the job done, although it mops in patches due to the design.
3) It’s very easy to assemble.
4) You can buy just the mop stick alone if you already have a mop tub.

Cons:
1) The mop’s thread material is quite delicate. After the first wash, at least three strands came out, and a few more falls off with each use. And will continue for sure, I know.

Overall, I’m still using it. It’s average but functional for daily use.

Cleaning with this brush is a breeze. The bristles do an excellent job of tackling tough stains and grime without scratching or damaging my bathroom fixtures. Plus, the wiper efficiently collects the residue, making the whole process more efficient and thorough.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with the bathroom cleaning brush with a wiper. Its impressive quality, efficient cleaning power, and convenient design have made my cleaning routine much more enjoyable. If you're looking for a top-notch bathroom cleaning tool, I highly recommend giving this brush a try. You won't be disappointed!

The video quality is too good and the setup is very easy. But the product needs lot of improvements which I am listing out below.
1. The tilt option is not that great and you can't focus the floor and door at the same time if it is installed above 5 feet high.
2. The 2 way talk option is just for name sake. The speaker quality is one of the worst one could imagine. You literally need to keep your ears in the camera to hear what the other one speaks.
3. Sound notifications and motion notifications are annoying which made me to disable them. Sound of crows and dogs far from home are detected (which happens all the time) and sends notifications. Similarly screen movements are sent as motion detection notifications. Detection of Human voice and motion alone could have been helpful and solved the real need.
4. Onvif never works. It asks for Password reset but if I select that nothing happens but freezing.
5. Smart controls seems not working. I have scheduled things for eg. Switch on the recording when it is 8am. But it never started to record.
6. Also there is no option to automate recording like Stop recording from Night 8 to Morning 8 every day.
7. Option to view in PC is too naive. If I wanted to view the feeds from office (or other phone restricted place), I can't do that as I need to scan the QR shown by the webpage through the mobile app. Even then it hardly works/opens.

Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reasonable pricing and of the correct size for cleaning purposes. Easy to use and very practical.,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a reliable and effective cleaning solution that effortlessly balances form and function. With a sturdy build and thoughtful design, these sponges prove to be a versatile companion in tackling various cleaning tasks around the house.

The pack's inclusion of six sponges ensures an extended period of use, making it a cost-effective option for those who require a long-lasting cleaning tool. The dual-sided design, featuring a scrubbing side and a softer wiping side, offers the flexibility needed to address both stubborn stains and delicate surfaces. This adaptability proves especially handy in the kitchen, where grime and grease are common adversaries.

One of the standout features of these sponges is their durability. The scrubbing side effectively removes tough residue without wearing down too quickly, while the wiping side maintains its integrity through multiple uses. This robustness translates into fewer replacements and less waste, contributing to a more sustainable cleaning routine.

While the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge pack delivers on its promises, there is room for slight improvement. The scrubbing surface, while effective, may feel abrasive on more delicate items. Additionally, a greater variety of colors or patterns could add a touch of visual appeal to the utilitarian design.

In conclusion, the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a dependable and practical cleaning tool that shines in its ability to adapt to different cleaning challenges. Its longevity, dual-sided functionality, and overall durability make it a solid investment for anyone seeking a reliable cleaning companion. While some refinements could enhance its aesthetic appeal, its performance remains the true highlight. Say goodbye to stubborn stains and embrace the convenience of these scrub sponges in your cleaning arsenal.

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this product in May-2024, total 3 nos for my different bathroom showers. After almost 3 months of usage. I'm forced to post this review. So everything was fine till date. Even the filter was doing a good job. The problem comes when u want to replace the cartridge or u want to change the position of the cartridge. So 1st time I changed the direction of cartridge from the filter upside down. This is required to be done as per the company's instruction. It took hell lot of ime to do this job..I don't know why they have made this filter and cartridge assembly in such a bad design that u cannot remove the cartridge from the filter. I did this anyhow and second time I tried this today with another filter but the cartridge is not getting separated whatever I tried. If the manufacturer wanted to sell cartridge as a replacement or consumable item then it should have been user friendly. Even entire cartridge got damaged but it didn't come out. I am had Even purchased extra cartridge for this filter..it's a waste for me now..I don't know any other person faced the same problems but this is the worst design i must say. Again the filter is expensive around 2k..u cannot waste this much money for 3-4 months usage.i would request water science team to see this and help me out,Pranav Kankee

Such useless products seems they are more reliant on paid reviews otherwise there is no explanation to generally good reviews when both the products i recieved were faulty,av123456

Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product to use for once and all. It is for day to day normal use and for normal stain utensils. Thank you.,S.S.
Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),4.0 out of 5 stars,Have always been purchasing the original scotch brite pads since they don't leave behind residue on the plates which we then inevitably digest while eating off plates. Because, let's face it, how much ever we wash the plates, there is always micro-residue from the cheap ripped off scrub pads in the market. The Scotch Brite scrub pads don't degrade like their cheap counterparts and hence last longer.

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this bottle cleaner. This is the second one I have ordered. I have kept one each at my home and my in law's place. It does the job. It does reach the bottom corners of the bottles as claimed. Overall a good one. I use it mostly for the kids bottles. It has a good reach. It dries quickly once you shake off as much water as you can.
The sponge is detachable from the handle as mentioned in the product description, to enable it to be changed once the sponge weras out. Now I haven't checked if the sponge head is available separately. Otherwise this is a bit expensive.,Mom to an autistic kid.
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,The scrubber given is very good and it cleans the milk residue properly , the only issue is that the handle detaches and the scrubber stays the bottle which is very hard to remove,Udayani

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this bottle cleaner for cleaning steel water bottle. I was facing issue with local brushes where the sponge on the lower part of the brush would get off quickly creating issues in cleaning the bottom of the bottle from inside. Did purchase this product with the hopes that it would solve this issue and the product delivered true to my expectations.

The only downside I see is that if the mouth of the bottle is a bit smaller, there can be issues in getting the brush outside without the risk of cleaning brush stuck inside the bottle.,Shantanu
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,Getting the perfect bottle cleaning brush is a hard task for Mommies.

5. Sound is ok
6. Rotation is smooth , but a very small sound while rotating. A person who is standing near to camera can notice this sound
7. Zooming is ok , but no optical zoom
8. Night vision is good
9. You can add presets and presets are working good. I am specifically telling this because presets won't work well in some other brand cameraz . But for tapo it is working very good.

10. You can adjust rotation angle and it is one of the feature missing in other camera.

11. Person detection is working well and you can easily differtiate normal motion detection with person detection by a person symbol on thumbnails.

Cons
1. Cloud storage is expensive
2. No optical zoom, only digital zoom. I didn't like zoom clarity compared to other 3mp models. If you want to zoom a large distance , don't take this.i own an ezviz 1k camera and i liked zoom clarity of that than this.
3. Can't control the siren as per our will.siren works only in motion detection. So if a small insect is flying , then it will make sound. But we can restrict it to human detection. I always prefer an alarm with a button which we can trigger from app.
4. Play back or recorded video in memory card fast-forward option is not via slider. You can select a speed and it will fast forward based on that. But I always prefer a slider for fast-forward.

5. Tapo is autorotating sometimes. Not sure why . I don't want this feature.
6. One major con I noticed is the wifi network updation . Most of the cameras now a days allow you to change wifi network via app . But for tapo we can't change wifi via app. I can see network selection is ready only field and no action on that.

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was skeptical when this camera was recommended to me. It looked both too easy to be of use, and too complicated to actually set up and use. I couldn't have been more wrong. This TP-Link Tapo security camera is just what I needed. I bought one to try and see, and the minute it was set up and I could see what it could do, Immediately ordered three more. It is an easy setup task, and the benefits of having them are so much more than I would have expected. They are also more affordable than I expected. I now have one in each of my main rooms, and I can see what's happening in my house from the office desk. I have yet to try to access my house through the camera from another country, but I have no doubt that it would work. I use it to make sure my pets are OK. The camera pans, tilts, has night vision, records, has a privacy mode, can be wall mounted or free standing, and I can talk through the camera, which will be a weight off my mind when I have to go abroad and need to see if my pet sitter is actually doing what has been asked of them. If I can feel like this about my pets, I can imagine how a parent might feel to be able to watch their children through them! I recommend these cameras with no hesitation. Just FYI - there is an option to sign up for a monthly payable cloud storage system for these cameras. But if you are not keen to do that, you have to buy a storage card to record what you need. (There is an option to turn on the privacy mode which means the cameras will only record if the privacy mode is switched off.)

Avec sa résolution 2K, la qualité d’image est impressionnante, offrant des vidéos nettes et claires, ce qui permet de capturer les moindres détails, même dans des conditions de faible luminosité. L’angle de vision de 360° et la possibilité de faire pivoter la caméra à distance via l’application Tapo ajoutent une flexibilité appréciable, permettant de couvrir une large zone avec un seul appareil.

L’installation est simple et rapide, même pour les moins technophiles. L’application Tapo est intuitive, rendant le contrôle de la caméra et l’accès aux vidéos enregistrées très faciles. De plus, la fonctionnalité de détection de mouvement et les notifications en temps réel sont très utiles pour rester informé de ce qui se passe chez soi.

Cependant, il y a quelques points à améliorer. Par exemple, la caméra nécessite une connexion Wi-Fi stable pour fonctionner de manière optimale, ce qui peut être un problème si le signal est faible. De plus, bien que la caméra soit livrée avec un emplacement pour carte microSD, le stockage en ligne est payant, ce qui peut représenter un coût supplémentaire à long terme.

En dépit de ces petits inconvénients, la Tapo 2K C210 reste un excellent rapport qualité-prix et je la recommande sans hésitation pour sécuriser votre domicile.

Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),3.0 out of 5 stars,The base is not stable by design. It swivels uncontrollably, and will fold over while scrubbing. So it is not possible to scrub without interruptions.

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s been about 4 days since I got this product and I’m happy with it as a baby monitor so far. It was easy to set up. As it can rest on any flat surface, I didn’t need to install it anywhere but it comes with all the necessary accessories for a wall mount. But because of the flat design I can put it anywhere near my baby, and even if I move her to another room, I can take the camera with me. The 360° rotation is impressive and the video quality is great, especially since I use it on the phone mostly—even 480p is sufficient.

The best features are the sound and movement triggers. If my little one wakes up annd moves around and/or cries, notifications are sent to my phone and the feed is also recorded for that portion (in case you want to check what disturbed them). This is great if you need to be in another room—gives you peace of mind. In fact, the sound trigger feature is not available in other cameras in this price range so this was the main deciding factor for my choice. The live feed is definitely a boon to make sure baby is fine when you’re away from her. You can also zoom in on the live feed, which is a cool little feature that I was not expecting. Plus, with the recording feature, you get to have little memories of the baby waking up saved away for the future :)

The only feature I’ve not had a chance to test is night vision but some videos of this camera I saw on YouTube seem to show that this feature is solid in the camera.

Right now I’m on the Imou Life trial subscription because it’s free and will save all recordings to the cloud (up to 3 days). I’ll move to a micro SD soon though. Thinking of also getting a power bank to make it truly portable. Overall, this device is great value and I’d recommend it for parents looking for a baby monitor.

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,3.0 out of 5 stars,The camera is really good. I am using it since 2 years and the performance is still decent. It has decent night vision and quality. It rotates 360° horizontally and 270° vertically. You can use sd card or buy their subscription for storage which I will talk about later. But!!! The most annoying thingಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ!!! Is actually it's software (⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)(⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)!!! I should write this thing in app's review but I think it should be added in product review too as it shows your experience using the product. So the first and major problem is that the app logs out every 3-4 days you don't use it which is very annoying. Imagine there is an emergency at your home and you need to turn on the camera ASAP, you open the app and boom!! Throw your emergency away and login here(⁠◠⁠ω◕⁠)!!
Also trust me, it is veryyy like very complicated and hard to login. The other issue is bro why do you even sell you products in India if you don't want to accept India's payment options. You can't use UPI apps it tells you to use paypal, bro seriously how the hell am I supposed to use paypal here or else use international cards :D!! And don't just use international cards but you have to buy the monthly subscription and trust me again it is very hard to cancel the subscription. I only need the camera twice or thrice a year so why should I waste my money in buying the subscription every month!?!??
Well this is my review it ends here.

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s been about 4 days since I got this product and I’m happy with it as a baby monitor so far. It was easy to set up. As it can rest on any flat surface, I didn’t need to install it anywhere but it comes with all the necessary accessories for a wall mount. But because of the flat design I can put it anywhere near my baby, and even if I move her to another room, I can take the camera with me. The 360° rotation is impressive and the video quality is great, especially since I use it on the phone mostly—even 480p is sufficient.

The best features are the sound and movement triggers. If my little one wakes up annd moves around and/or cries, notifications are sent to my phone and the feed is also recorded for that portion (in case you want to check what disturbed them). This is great if you need to be in another room—gives you peace of mind. In fact, the sound trigger feature is not available in other cameras in this price range so this was the main deciding factor for my choice. The live feed is definitely a boon to make sure baby is fine when you’re away from her. You can also zoom in on the live feed, which is a cool little feature that I was not expecting. Plus, with the recording feature, you get to have little memories of the baby waking up saved away for the future :)

The only feature I’ve not had a chance to test is night vision but some videos of this camera I saw on YouTube seem to show that this feature is solid in the camera.

TNT THE NEXT TREND Ladder for Home use Heavy Duty Steel with Wide Steps and Top Platform with Anti Slip and Anti Skid Shoes can be Used as Step Stool in Office and Industrial Purpose (Black) (3 Step),1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this 2-step ladder with the expectation of it being sturdy, especially given the company’s claim that it can handle up to 150 kg. However, after just six months of light, home use by individuals weighing around 70-80 kg, one of the foot steps cracked, making it unsafe to use. This is disappointing for a product advertised as durable and capable of supporting much heavier weights. The quality feels subpar, and it’s clear the ladder isn’t built to withstand regular use. I wouldn’t recommend this product if you're looking for something reliable and long-lasting.,mani

Ozone Safe Locker for Home | Digital Lock | Safety Locker For Home | Non Motorized | Master & User PIN Code Access | Tijori Locker | Black | 16 Litres | 24 Months Warranty By Ozone (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,The secure locker arrived packaged in the branded box, cushioned on both sides with safety pads. However, the box lacked a proper seal, featuring only a simple cello tape adorned with the brand name. Setting up the safe proved to be straightforward, thanks to the provided instructions. It would have been beneficial if the instructions also covered setting the date and time, but I managed to navigate it by referring to their instructional YouTube video.

Upon opening the safe, I noticed it was disappointingly dirty. It's essential for the dispatch team to ensure cleanliness by removing paint, dust, and other debris before shipping the product. The carpet in the lower slot, while present, is inadequately glued and doesn't fit properly. Furthermore, the carpet piece's size does not match the dimensions, resulting in unsightly folds. The key is flimsy and seems generic, I am worried that any one with similar key can open the locker which totally defies the purpose of having the locker at first place.

The outer body of the safe is robust and well-constructed, seemingly made in India. However, my concern lies with the locking mechanism, which is made in China and appears flimsy. Only time will reveal the true durability of the safe. Additionally, the product seems slightly overpriced compared to competitors such as Amazon Basics safe lockers.

Despite these drawbacks, I recommend the product based on its overall performance and construction.

Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL (Modular,1 Piece),5.0 out of 5 stars,Firstly, the modular design of this broom is very convenient. It comes in 1 piece, making it easy to assemble and use. The handle is also adjustable, which is perfect for someone like me who is on the shorter side. I can adjust the handle to my desired length for comfortable sweeping. One of the main features that drew me to this broom was the promise of no dust. I have always struggled with traditional brooms leaving behind a trail of dust and debris. However, the Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL lives up to its name. The bristles are made of soft, fine fibers that effectively pick up all the dust and dirt without scattering it around. This has made sweeping a much cleaner and less messy task. Another great feature of this broom is its XL size. The broom head is wider than most traditional brooms, which means I can cover more surface area with each sweep. This has significantly reduced my cleaning time. The broom is also lightweight, making it easy to maneuver around furniture and corners. The quality of this broom is top-notch. The bristles are strong and durable, and they have not shown any signs of wear and tear even after multiple uses. The handle is also sturdy and feels comfortable to hold.,One Malabar Hill

Scotch-Brite Plastic Spin Mop Head and Handle (Suitable for Scotch-Brite 2 in 1 Spin Mop Only),3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this mop from Scotch Brite because I was frustrated with the Prestige ones, many of which now seem to be fake copies. Although this one is a bit pricey, it’s been working well after several months of use.

Pros:
1) The spin mechanism is effective; it dries quickly after just two spins.
2) The mopping material is decent and gets the job done, although it mops in patches due to the design.
3) It’s very easy to assemble.
4) You can buy just the mop stick alone if you already have a mop tub.

Cons:
1) The mop’s thread material is quite delicate. After the first wash, at least three strands came out, and a few more falls off with each use. And will continue for sure, I know.

Overall, I’m still using it. It’s average but functional for daily use.

Scotch-Brite Plastic Spin Mop Head and Handle (Suitable for Scotch-Brite 2 in 1 Spin Mop Only),3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this mop from Scotch Brite because I was frustrated with the Prestige ones, many of which now seem to be fake copies. Although this one is a bit pricey, it’s been working well after several months of use.

Pros:
1) The spin mechanism is effective; it dries quickly after just two spins.
2) The mopping material is decent and gets the job done, although it mops in patches due to the design.
3) It’s very easy to assemble.

Rushwak Bathroom Cleaning Brush with Wiper Upgraded 3 in 1 Toilet Brush Bathroom Brush with Long Handle 180° Rotate Bathroom Floor Cleaning Brush Bathroom Cleaning Accessories (Multicolor),5.0 out of 5 stars,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I recently purchased the bathroom cleaning brush with a wiper, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way possible! This product is a game-changer when it comes to keeping my bathroom spotless and gleaming.

First and foremost, the quality of this brush is outstanding. The bristles are sturdy and durable, ensuring they don't wear out quickly even with regular use. The handle is comfortable to grip, and the overall construction feels solid and well-made. I can tell that this brush is built to last, which makes it a fantastic investment for my cleaning arsenal.

The wiper feature is what truly sets this bathroom brush apart from others on the market. It's incredibly handy for wiping away excess water and cleaning solution, leaving my bathroom surfaces completely dry and streak-free. This saves me a lot of time and effort, as I don't have to reach for a separate cloth or paper towel to wipe down surfaces after scrubbing.

Cleaning with this brush is a breeze. The bristles do an excellent job of tackling tough stains and grime without scratching or damaging my bathroom fixtures. Plus, the wiper efficiently collects the residue, making the whole process more efficient and thorough.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with the bathroom cleaning brush with a wiper. Its impressive quality, efficient cleaning power, and convenient design have made my cleaning routine much more enjoyable. If you're looking for a top-notch bathroom cleaning tool, I highly recommend giving this brush a try. You won't be disappointed!

The video quality is too good and the setup is very easy. But the product needs lot of improvements which I am listing out below.
1. The tilt option is not that great and you can't focus the floor and door at the same time if it is installed above 5 feet high.
2. The 2 way talk option is just for name sake. The speaker quality is one of the worst one could imagine. You literally need to keep your ears in the camera to hear what the other one speaks.
3. Sound notifications and motion notifications are annoying which made me to disable them. Sound of crows and dogs far from home are detected (which happens all the time) and sends notifications. Similarly screen movements are sent as motion detection notifications. Detection of Human voice and motion alone could have been helpful and solved the real need.
4. Onvif never works. It asks for Password reset but if I select that nothing happens but freezing.
5. Smart controls seems not working. I have scheduled things for eg. Switch on the recording when it is 8am. But it never started to record.
6. Also there is no option to automate recording like Stop recording from Night 8 to Morning 8 every day.
7. Option to view in PC is too naive. If I wanted to view the feeds from office (or other phone restricted place), I can't do that as I need to scan the QR shown by the webpage through the mobile app. Even then it hardly works/opens.

The video quality is too good and the setup is very easy. But the product needs lot of improvements which I am listing out below.
1. The tilt option is not that great and you can't focus the floor and door at the same time if it is installed above 5 feet high.
2. The 2 way talk option is just for name sake. The speaker quality is one of the worst one could imagine. You literally need to keep your ears in the camera to hear what the other one speaks.
3. Sound notifications and motion notifications are annoying which made me to disable them. Sound of crows and dogs far from home are detected (which happens all the time) and sends notifications. Similarly screen movements are sent as motion detection notifications. Detection of Human voice and motion alone could have been helpful and solved the real need.
4. Onvif never works. It asks for Password reset but if I select that nothing happens but freezing.
5. Smart controls seems not working. I have scheduled things for eg. Switch on the recording when it is 8am. But it never started to record.
6. Also there is no option to automate recording like Stop recording from Night 8 to Morning 8 every day.
7. Option to view in PC is too naive. If I wanted to view the feeds from office (or other phone restricted place), I can't do that as I need to scan the QR shown by the webpage through the mobile app. Even then it hardly works/opens.

Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reasonable pricing and of the correct size for cleaning purposes. Easy to use and very practical.,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a reliable and effective cleaning solution that effortlessly balances form and function. With a sturdy build and thoughtful design, these sponges prove to be a versatile companion in tackling various cleaning tasks around the house.

The pack's inclusion of six sponges ensures an extended period of use, making it a cost-effective option for those who require a long-lasting cleaning tool. The dual-sided design, featuring a scrubbing side and a softer wiping side, offers the flexibility needed to address both stubborn stains and delicate surfaces. This adaptability proves especially handy in the kitchen, where grime and grease are common adversaries.

One of the standout features of these sponges is their durability. The scrubbing side effectively removes tough residue without wearing down too quickly, while the wiping side maintains its integrity through multiple uses. This robustness translates into fewer replacements and less waste, contributing to a more sustainable cleaning routine.

While the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge pack delivers on its promises, there is room for slight improvement. The scrubbing surface, while effective, may feel abrasive on more delicate items. Additionally, a greater variety of colors or patterns could add a touch of visual appeal to the utilitarian design.

In conclusion, the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a dependable and practical cleaning tool that shines in its ability to adapt to different cleaning challenges. Its longevity, dual-sided functionality, and overall durability make it a solid investment for anyone seeking a reliable cleaning companion. While some refinements could enhance its aesthetic appeal, its performance remains the true highlight. Say goodbye to stubborn stains and embrace the convenience of these scrub sponges in your cleaning arsenal.

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this product in May-2024, total 3 nos for my different bathroom showers. After almost 3 months of usage. I'm forced to post this review. So everything was fine till date. Even the filter was doing a good job. The problem comes when u want to replace the cartridge or u want to change the position of the cartridge. So 1st time I changed the direction of cartridge from the filter upside down. This is required to be done as per the company's instruction. It took hell lot of ime to do this job..I don't know why they have made this filter and cartridge assembly in such a bad design that u cannot remove the cartridge from the filter. I did this anyhow and second time I tried this today with another filter but the cartridge is not getting separated whatever I tried. If the manufacturer wanted to sell cartridge as a replacement or consumable item then it should have been user friendly. Even entire cartridge got damaged but it didn't come out. I am had Even purchased extra cartridge for this filter..it's a waste for me now..I don't know any other person faced the same problems but this is the worst design i must say. Again the filter is expensive around 2k..u cannot waste this much money for 3-4 months usage.i would request water science team to see this and help me out,Pranav Kankee

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,5.0 out of 5 stars,This hard water filter works amazingly well. It's really helpful for people living in Pune since the water is very hard.

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had ordered 2 filters inspite of many bad reviews. One filter is working fine but second has water leaking from the body. Installation is easy but the key tool provided is useless to say the least.
Edit: the filter which was working fine was not used for 15 days and now it has choked. Water is not passing through it. Such useless products seems they are more reliant on paid reviews otherwise there is no explanation to generally good reviews when both the products i recieved were faulty,av123456

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this product in May-2024, total 3 nos for my different bathroom showers. After almost 3 months of usage. I'm forced to post this review. So everything was fine till date. Even the filter was doing a good job. The problem comes when u want to replace the cartridge or u want to change the position of the cartridge. So 1st time I changed the direction of cartridge from the filter upside down. This is required to be done as per the company's instruction. It took hell lot of ime to do this job..I don't know why they have made this filter and cartridge assembly in such a bad design that u cannot remove the cartridge from the filter. I did this anyhow and second time I tried this today with another filter but the cartridge is not getting separated whatever I tried. If the manufacturer wanted to sell cartridge as a replacement or consumable item then it should have been user friendly. Even entire cartridge got damaged but it didn't come out. I am had Even purchased extra cartridge for this filter..it's a waste for me now..I don't know any other person faced the same problems but this is the worst design i must say. Again the filter is expensive around 2k..u cannot waste this much money for 3-4 months usage.i would request water science team to see this and help me out,Pranav Kankee

Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product to use for once and all. It is for day to day normal use and for normal stain utensils. Thank you.,S.S.
Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),4.0 out of 5 stars,Have always been purchasing the original scotch brite pads since they don't leave behind residue on the plates which we then inevitably digest while eating off plates. Because, let's face it, how much ever we wash the plates, there is always micro-residue from the cheap ripped off scrub pads in the market. The Scotch Brite scrub pads don't degrade like their cheap counterparts and hence last longer.

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this bottle cleaner. This is the second one I have ordered. I have kept one each at my home and my in law's place. It does the job. It does reach the bottom corners of the bottles as claimed. Overall a good one. I use it mostly for the kids bottles. It has a good reach. It dries quickly once you shake off as much water as you can.
The sponge is detachable from the handle as mentioned in the product description, to enable it to be changed once the sponge weras out. Now I haven't checked if the sponge head is available separately. Otherwise this is a bit expensive.,Mom to an autistic kid.

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this bottle cleaner for cleaning steel water bottle. I was facing issue with local brushes where the sponge on the lower part of the brush would get off quickly creating issues in cleaning the bottom of the bottle from inside. Did purchase this product with the hopes that it would solve this issue and the product delivered true to my expectations.

The only downside I see is that if the mouth of the bottle is a bit smaller, there can be issues in getting the brush outside without the risk of cleaning brush stuck inside the bottle.,Shantanu

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,4.0 out of 5 stars,Updating my review after one month of use. No change in my rating and just updating more prons and cons

Pros
1. Good indoor camera for normal use.
2. Configuring is easy
3.Tapo app is responsive and working good
4. Video Clarity is ok
5. Sound is ok
6. Rotation is smooth , but a very small sound while rotating. A person who is standing near to camera can notice this sound
7. Zooming is ok , but no optical zoom
8. Night vision is good
9. You can add presets and presets are working good. I am specifically telling this because presets won't work well in some other brand cameraz . But for tapo it is working very good.

10. You can adjust rotation angle and it is one of the feature missing in other camera.

11. Person detection is working well and you can easily differtiate normal motion detection with person detection by a person symbol on thumbnails.

Cons
1. Cloud storage is expensive
2. No optical zoom, only digital zoom. I didn't like zoom clarity compared to other 3mp models. If you want to zoom a large distance , don't take this.i own an ezviz 1k camera and i liked zoom clarity of that than this.
3. Can't control the siren as per our will.siren works only in motion detection. So if a small insect is flying , then it will make sound. But we can restrict it to human detection. I always prefer an alarm with a button which we can trigger from app.
4. Play back or recorded video in memory card fast-forward option is not via slider. You can select a speed and it will fast forward based on that. But I always prefer a slider for fast-forward.

5. Tapo is autorotating sometimes. Not sure why . I don't want this feature.
6. One major con I noticed is the wifi network updation . Most of the cameras now a days allow you to change wifi network via app . But for tapo we can't change wifi via app. I can see network selection is ready only field and no action on that.

It looked both too easy to be of use, and too complicated to actually set up and use. I couldn't have been more wrong. This TP-Link Tapo security camera is just what I needed. I bought one to try and see, and the minute it was set up and I could see what it could do, Immediately ordered three more. It is an easy setup task, and the benefits of having them are so much more than I would have expected. They are also more affordable than I expected. I now have one in each of my main rooms, and I can see what's happening in my house from the office desk. I have yet to try to access my house through the camera from another country, but I have no doubt that it would work. I use it to make sure my pets are OK. The camera pans, tilts, has night vision, records, has a privacy mode, can be wall mounted or free standing, and I can talk through the camera, which will be a weight off my mind when I have to go abroad and need to see if my pet sitter is actually doing what has been asked of them. If I can feel like this about my pets, I can imagine how a parent might feel to be able to watch their children through them! I recommend these cameras with no hesitation. Just FYI - there is an option to sign up for a monthly payable cloud storage system for these cameras. But if you are not keen to do that, you have to buy a storage card to record what you need. (There is an option to turn on the privacy mode which means the cameras will only record if the privacy mode is switched off.)

We were out of town for few days and this camera is suppose to monitor the house, but unfortunately it worked for only two days. WiFi was working fine other cameras from Philips was doing their job. But this Tapo camera went offline and did nothing for rest of the time. I have enabled the auto restart setting on daily intervals, but I believe that didn’t work. Tried to reach out customer care, but they will not respond, and since the product is working fine and issue is intermittent, was not able to show to the customer care. Think before you buy.

Avec sa résolution 2K, la qualité d’image est impressionnante, offrant des vidéos nettes et claires, ce qui permet de capturer les moindres détails, même dans des conditions de faible luminosité. L’angle de vision de 360° et la possibilité de faire pivoter la caméra à distance via l’application Tapo ajoutent une flexibilité appréciable, permettant de couvrir une large zone avec un seul appareil.

L’installation est simple et rapide, même pour les moins technophiles. L’application Tapo est intuitive, rendant le contrôle de la caméra et l’accès aux vidéos enregistrées très faciles. De plus, la fonctionnalité de détection de mouvement et les notifications en temps réel sont très utiles pour rester informé de ce qui se passe chez soi.

Cependant, il y a quelques points à améliorer. Par exemple, la caméra nécessite une connexion Wi-Fi stable pour fonctionner de manière optimale, ce qui peut être un problème si le signal est faible. De plus, bien que la caméra soit livrée avec un emplacement pour carte microSD, le stockage en ligne est payant, ce qui peut représenter un coût supplémentaire à long terme.

En dépit de ces petits inconvénients, la Tapo 2K C210 reste un excellent rapport qualité-prix et je la recommande sans hésitation pour sécuriser votre domicile.

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,4.0 out of 5 stars,Updating my review after one month of use. No change in my rating and just updating more prons and cons

Pros
1. Good indoor camera for normal use.
2. Configuring is easy
3.Tapo app is responsive and working good
4. Video Clarity is ok
5. Sound is ok
6. Rotation is smooth , but a very small sound while rotating. A person who is standing near to camera can notice this sound
7. Zooming is ok , but no optical zoom
8. Night vision is good
9. You can add presets and presets are working good. I am specifically telling this because presets won't work well in some other brand cameraz . But for tapo it is working very good.

10. You can adjust rotation angle and it is one of the feature missing in other camera.

11. Person detection is working well and you can easily differtiate normal motion detection with person detection by a person symbol on thumbnails.

Cons
1. Cloud storage is expensive
2. No optical zoom, only digital zoom. I didn't like zoom clarity compared to other 3mp models. If you want to zoom a large distance , don't take this.i own an ezviz 1k camera and i liked zoom clarity of that than this.
3. Can't control the siren as per our will.siren works only in motion detection. So if a small insect is flying , then it will make sound. But we can restrict it to human detection. I always prefer an alarm with a button which we can trigger from app.
4. Play back or recorded video in memory card fast-forward option is not via slider. You can select a speed and it will fast forward based on that. But I always prefer a slider for fast-forward.

5. Tapo is autorotating sometimes. Not sure why . I don't want this feature.
6. One major con I noticed is the wifi network updation . Most of the cameras now a days allow you to change wifi network via app . But for tapo we can't change wifi via app. I can see network selection is ready only field and no action on that.

It looked both too easy to be of use, and too complicated to actually set up and use. I couldn't have been more wrong. This TP-Link Tapo security camera is just what I needed. I bought one to try and see, and the minute it was set up and I could see what it could do, Immediately ordered three more. It is an easy setup task, and the benefits of having them are so much more than I would have expected. They are also more affordable than I expected. I now have one in each of my main rooms, and I can see what's happening in my house from the office desk. I have yet to try to access my house through the camera from another country, but I have no doubt that it would work. I use it to make sure my pets are OK. The camera pans, tilts, has night vision, records, has a privacy mode, can be wall mounted or free standing, and I can talk through the camera, which will be a weight off my mind when I have to go abroad and need to see if my pet sitter is actually doing what has been asked of them. If I can feel like this about my pets, I can imagine how a parent might feel to be able to watch their children through them! I recommend these cameras with no hesitation. Just FYI - there is an option to sign up for a monthly payable cloud storage system for these cameras. But if you are not keen to do that, you have to buy a storage card to record what you need. (There is an option to turn on the privacy mode which means the cameras will only record if the privacy mode is switched off.)

We were out of town for few days and this camera is suppose to monitor the house, but unfortunately it worked for only two days. WiFi was working fine other cameras from Philips was doing their job. But this Tapo camera went offline and did nothing for rest of the time. I have enabled the auto restart setting on daily intervals, but I believe that didn’t work. Tried to reach out customer care, but they will not respond, and since the product is working fine and issue is intermittent, was not able to show to the customer care. Think before you buy. Go with Philips cameras as they support offline recordings, though they are bit costly.,shreyas

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s been about 4 days since I got this product and I’m happy with it as a baby monitor so far. It was easy to set up. As it can rest on any flat surface, I didn’t need to install it anywhere but it comes with all the necessary accessories for a wall mount. But because of the flat design I can put it anywhere near my baby, and even if I move her to another room, I can take the camera with me. The 360° rotation is impressive and the video quality is great, especially since I use it on the phone mostly—even 480p is sufficient.

The best features are the sound and movement triggers. If my little one wakes up annd moves around and/or cries, notifications are sent to my phone and the feed is also recorded for that portion (in case you want to check what disturbed them). This is great if you need to be in another room—gives you peace of mind. In fact, the sound trigger feature is not available in other cameras in this price range so this was the main deciding factor for my choice. The live feed is definitely a boon to make sure baby is fine when you’re away from her. You can also zoom in on the live feed, which is a cool little feature that I was not expecting. Plus, with the recording feature, you get to have little memories of the baby waking up saved away for the future :)

The only feature I’ve not had a chance to test is night vision but some videos of this camera I saw on YouTube seem to show that this feature is solid in the camera.

Right now I’m on the Imou Life trial subscription because it’s free and will save all recordings to the cloud (up to 3 days). I’ll move to a micro SD soon though. Thinking of also getting a power bank to make it truly portable. Overall, this device is great value and I’d recommend it for parents looking for a baby monitor.

I am using it since 2 years and the performance is still decent. It has decent night vision and quality. It rotates 360° horizontally and 270° vertically. You can use sd card or buy their subscription for storage which I will talk about later. But!!! The most annoying thingಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ!!! Is actually it's software (⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)(⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)!!! I should write this thing in app's review but I think it should be added in product review too as it shows your experience using the product. So the first and major problem is that the app logs out every 3-4 days you don't use it which is very annoying. Imagine there is an emergency at your home and you need to turn on the camera ASAP, you open the app and boom!! Throw your emergency away and login here(⁠◠⁠ω◕⁠)!!
Also trust me, it is veryyy like very complicated and hard to login. The other issue is bro why do you even sell you products in India if you don't want to accept India's payment options. You can't use UPI apps it tells you to use paypal, bro seriously how the hell am I supposed to use paypal here or else use international cards :D!! And don't just use international cards but you have to buy the monthly subscription and trust me again it is very hard to cancel the subscription. I only need the camera twice or thrice a year so why should I waste my money in buying the subscription every month!?!??
Well this is my review it ends here.

In first order the product had defect but when I contacted it's customer support they reverted immediately and was replaced in 2 days with new one. So they after service is also very good.

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s been about 4 days since I got this product and I’m happy with it as a baby monitor so far. It was easy to set up. As it can rest on any flat surface, I didn’t need to install it anywhere but it comes with all the necessary accessories for a wall mount. But because of the flat design I can put it anywhere near my baby, and even if I move her to another room, I can take the camera with me. The 360° rotation is impressive and the video quality is great, especially since I use it on the phone mostly—even 480p is sufficient.

The best features are the sound and movement triggers. If my little one wakes up annd moves around and/or cries, notifications are sent to my phone and the feed is also recorded for that portion (in case you want to check what disturbed them). This is great if you need to be in another room—gives you peace of mind. In fact, the sound trigger feature is not available in other cameras in this price range so this was the main deciding factor for my choice. The live feed is definitely a boon to make sure baby is fine when you’re away from her. You can also zoom in on the live feed, which is a cool little feature that I was not expecting. Plus, with the recording feature, you get to have little memories of the baby waking up saved away for the future :)

The only feature I’ve not had a chance to test is night vision but some videos of this camera I saw on YouTube seem to show that this feature is solid in the camera.

Right now I’m on the Imou Life trial subscription because it’s free and will save all recordings to the cloud (up to 3 days). I’ll move to a micro SD soon though. Thinking of also getting a power bank to make it truly portable. Overall, this device is great value and I’d recommend it for parents looking for a baby monitor.

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,3.0 out of 5 stars,The camera is really good. I am using it since 2 years and the performance is still decent. It has decent night vision and quality. It rotates 360° horizontally and 270° vertically. You can use sd card or buy their subscription for storage which I will talk about later. But!!! The most annoying thingಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ!!! Is actually it's software (⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)(⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)!!! I should write this thing in app's review but I think it should be added in product review too as it shows your experience using the product. So the first and major problem is that the app logs out every 3-4 days you don't use it which is very annoying. Imagine there is an emergency at your home and you need to turn on the camera ASAP, you open the app and boom!! Throw your emergency away and login here(⁠◠⁠ω◕⁠)!!
Also trust me, it is veryyy like very complicated and hard to login. The other issue is bro why do you even sell you products in India if you don't want to accept India's payment options. You can't use UPI apps it tells you to use paypal, bro seriously how the hell am I supposed to use paypal here or else use international cards :D!! And don't just use international cards but you have to buy the monthly subscription and trust me again it is very hard to cancel the subscription. I only need the camera twice or thrice a year so why should I waste my money in buying the subscription every month!?!??
Well this is my review it ends here.

In first order the product had defect but when I contacted it's customer support they reverted immediately and was replaced in 2 days with new one. So they after service is also very good. Just one thing I am facing problem is SIREN is not playing properly it's getting stop in 2-3 seconds instead of 30 seconds. But overall product is fabulous in the price that is offered. Just go for it.,Amazon Customer

TNT THE NEXT TREND Ladder for Home use Heavy Duty Steel with Wide Steps and Top Platform with Anti Slip and Anti Skid Shoes can be Used as Step Stool in Office and Industrial Purpose (Black) (3 Step),1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this 2-step ladder with the expectation of it being sturdy, especially given the company’s claim that it can handle up to 150 kg. However, after just six months of light, home use by individuals weighing around 70-80 kg, one of the foot steps cracked, making it unsafe to use. This is disappointing for a product advertised as durable and capable of supporting much heavier weights. The quality feels subpar, and it’s clear the ladder isn’t built to withstand regular use. I wouldn’t recommend this product if you're looking for something reliable and long-lasting.,mani

Ozone Safe Locker for Home | Digital Lock | Safety Locker For Home | Non Motorized | Master & User PIN Code Access | Tijori Locker | Black | 16 Litres | 24 Months Warranty By Ozone (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,The secure locker arrived packaged in the branded box, cushioned on both sides with safety pads. However, the box lacked a proper seal, featuring only a simple cello tape adorned with the brand name. Setting up the safe proved to be straightforward, thanks to the provided instructions. It would have been beneficial if the instructions also covered setting the date and time, but I managed to navigate it by referring to their instructional YouTube video.

Upon opening the safe, I noticed it was disappointingly dirty. It's essential for the dispatch team to ensure cleanliness by removing paint, dust, and other debris before shipping the product. The carpet in the lower slot, while present, is inadequately glued and doesn't fit properly. Furthermore, the carpet piece's size does not match the dimensions, resulting in unsightly folds. The key is flimsy and seems generic, I am worried that any one with similar key can open the locker which totally defies the purpose of having the locker at first place.

The outer body of the safe is robust and well-constructed, seemingly made in India. However, my concern lies with the locking mechanism, which is made in China and appears flimsy. Only time will reveal the true durability of the safe. Additionally, the product seems slightly overpriced compared to competitors such as Amazon Basics safe lockers.

Despite these drawbacks, I recommend the product based on its overall performance and construction.

Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL (Modular,1 Piece),5.0 out of 5 stars,Firstly, the modular design of this broom is very convenient. It comes in 1 piece, making it easy to assemble and use. The handle is also adjustable, which is perfect for someone like me who is on the shorter side. I can adjust the handle to my desired length for comfortable sweeping. One of the main features that drew me to this broom was the promise of no dust. I have always struggled with traditional brooms leaving behind a trail of dust and debris. However, the Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL lives up to its name. The bristles are made of soft, fine fibers that effectively pick up all the dust and dirt without scattering it around. This has made sweeping a much cleaner and less messy task. Another great feature of this broom is its XL size. The broom head is wider than most traditional brooms, which means I can cover more surface area with each sweep. This has significantly reduced my cleaning time. The broom is also lightweight, making it easy to maneuver around furniture and corners. The quality of this broom is top-notch. The bristles are strong and durable, and they have not shown any signs of wear and tear even after multiple uses. The handle is also sturdy and feels comfortable to hold.,One Malabar Hill

Scotch-Brite Plastic Spin Mop Head and Handle (Suitable for Scotch-Brite 2 in 1 Spin Mop Only),3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this mop from Scotch Brite because I was frustrated with the Prestige ones, many of which now seem to be fake copies. Although this one is a bit pricey, it’s been working well after several months of use.

Pros:
1) The spin mechanism is effective; it dries quickly after just two spins.
2) The mopping material is decent and gets the job done, although it mops in patches due to the design.
3) It’s very easy to assemble.
4) You can buy just the mop stick alone if you already have a mop tub.

Cons:
1) The mop’s thread material is quite delicate. After the first wash, at least three strands came out, and a few more falls off with each use. And will continue for sure, I know.

Overall, I’m still using it. It’s average but functional for daily use.

Rushwak Bathroom Cleaning Brush with Wiper Upgraded 3 in 1 Toilet Brush Bathroom Brush with Long Handle 180° Rotate Bathroom Floor Cleaning Brush Bathroom Cleaning Accessories (Multicolor),5.0 out of 5 stars,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I recently purchased the bathroom cleaning brush with a wiper, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way possible! This product is a game-changer when it comes to keeping my bathroom spotless and gleaming.

First and foremost, the quality of this brush is outstanding. The bristles are sturdy and durable, ensuring they don't wear out quickly even with regular use. The handle is comfortable to grip, and the overall construction feels solid and well-made. I can tell that this brush is built to last, which makes it a fantastic investment for my cleaning arsenal.

The wiper feature is what truly sets this bathroom brush apart from others on the market. It's incredibly handy for wiping away excess water and cleaning solution, leaving my bathroom surfaces completely dry and streak-free. This saves me a lot of time and effort, as I don't have to reach for a separate cloth or paper towel to wipe down surfaces after scrubbing.

Cleaning with this brush is a breeze. The bristles do an excellent job of tackling tough stains and grime without scratching or damaging my bathroom fixtures. Plus, the wiper efficiently collects the residue, making the whole process more efficient and thorough.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with the bathroom cleaning brush with a wiper. Its impressive quality, efficient cleaning power, and convenient design have made my cleaning routine much more enjoyable. If you're looking for a top-notch bathroom cleaning tool, I highly recommend giving this brush a try. You won't be disappointed!

The video quality is too good and the setup is very easy. But the product needs lot of improvements which I am listing out below.
1. The tilt option is not that great and you can't focus the floor and door at the same time if it is installed above 5 feet high.
2. The 2 way talk option is just for name sake. The speaker quality is one of the worst one could imagine. You literally need to keep your ears in the camera to hear what the other one speaks.
3. Sound notifications and motion notifications are annoying which made me to disable them. Sound of crows and dogs far from home are detected (which happens all the time) and sends notifications. Similarly screen movements are sent as motion detection notifications. Detection of Human voice and motion alone could have been helpful and solved the real need.
4. Onvif never works. It asks for Password reset but if I select that nothing happens but freezing.
5. Smart controls seems not working. I have scheduled things for eg. Switch on the recording when it is 8am. But it never started to record.
6. Also there is no option to automate recording like Stop recording from Night 8 to Morning 8 every day.
7. Option to view in PC is too naive. If I wanted to view the feeds from office (or other phone restricted place), I can't do that as I need to scan the QR shown by the webpage through the mobile app. Even then it hardly works/opens.

Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reasonable pricing and of the correct size for cleaning purposes. Easy to use and very practical.,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a reliable and effective cleaning solution that effortlessly balances form and function. With a sturdy build and thoughtful design, these sponges prove to be a versatile companion in tackling various cleaning tasks around the house.

The pack's inclusion of six sponges ensures an extended period of use, making it a cost-effective option for those who require a long-lasting cleaning tool. The dual-sided design, featuring a scrubbing side and a softer wiping side, offers the flexibility needed to address both stubborn stains and delicate surfaces. This adaptability proves especially handy in the kitchen, where grime and grease are common adversaries.

One of the standout features of these sponges is their durability. The scrubbing side effectively removes tough residue without wearing down too quickly, while the wiping side maintains its integrity through multiple uses. This robustness translates into fewer replacements and less waste, contributing to a more sustainable cleaning routine.

While the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge pack delivers on its promises, there is room for slight improvement. The scrubbing surface, while effective, may feel abrasive on more delicate items. Additionally, a greater variety of colors or patterns could add a touch of visual appeal to the utilitarian design.

In conclusion, the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a dependable and practical cleaning tool that shines in its ability to adapt to different cleaning challenges. Its longevity, dual-sided functionality, and overall durability make it a solid investment for anyone seeking a reliable cleaning companion. While some refinements could enhance its aesthetic appeal, its performance remains the true highlight. Say goodbye to stubborn stains and embrace the convenience of these scrub sponges in your cleaning arsenal.

This is required to be done as per the company's instruction. It took hell lot of ime to do this job..I don't know why they have made this filter and cartridge assembly in such a bad design that u cannot remove the cartridge from the filter. I did this anyhow and second time I tried this today with another filter but the cartridge is not getting separated whatever I tried. If the manufacturer wanted to sell cartridge as a replacement or consumable item then it should have been user friendly. Even entire cartridge got damaged but it didn't come out.

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,4.0 out of 5 stars,Does it's job well. Quality and manual is good. Spare connectors are helpful. Changing cartridge every 6 months is a task and cost involved.,P.L.Kori
WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had ordered 2 filters inspite of many bad reviews. One filter is working fine but second has water leaking from the body. Installation is easy but the key tool provided is useless to say the least.
Edit: the filter which was working fine was not used for 15 days and now it has choked. Water is not passing through it. Such useless products seems they are more reliant on paid reviews otherwise there is no explanation to generally good reviews when both the products i recieved were faulty,av123456

Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product to use for once and all. It is for day to day normal use and for normal stain utensils. Thank you.,S.S.
Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),4.0 out of 5 stars,Have always been purchasing the original scotch brite pads since they don't leave behind residue on the plates which we then inevitably digest while eating off plates. Because, let's face it, how much ever we wash the plates, there is always micro-residue from the cheap ripped off scrub pads in the market. The Scotch Brite scrub pads don't degrade like their cheap counterparts and hence last longer.
Price could be cheaper but then this is a premium product with the 3M logo. Gotta pay for the brand and the quality.,su-personic

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this bottle cleaner. This is the second one I have ordered. I have kept one each at my home and my in law's place. It does the job. It does reach the bottom corners of the bottles as claimed. Overall a good one. I use it mostly for the kids bottles. It has a good reach. It dries quickly once you shake off as much water as you can.
The sponge is detachable from the handle as mentioned in the product description, to enable it to be changed once the sponge weras out. Now I haven't checked if the sponge head is available separately. Otherwise this is a bit expensive.,Mom to an autistic kid.
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,The scrubber given is very good and it cleans the milk residue properly , the only issue is that the handle detaches and the scrubber stays the bottle which is very hard to remove,Udayani

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this bottle cleaner for cleaning steel water bottle. I was facing issue with local brushes where the sponge on the lower part of the brush would get off quickly creating issues in cleaning the bottom of the bottle from inside. Did purchase this product with the hopes that it would solve this issue and the product delivered true to my expectations.

The only downside I see is that if the mouth of the bottle is a bit smaller, there can be issues in getting the brush outside without the risk of cleaning brush stuck inside the bottle.,Shantanu
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,Getting the perfect bottle cleaning brush is a hard task for Mommies.

I suggest Team Scotch Brite to make a smaller one of this for kids feeding bottles.,Aprajita Mishra

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,4.0 out of 5 stars,Updating my review after one month of use. No change in my rating and just updating more prons and cons

Pros
1. Good indoor camera for normal use.
2. Configuring is easy
3.Tapo app is responsive and working good
4. Video Clarity is ok
5. Sound is ok
6. Rotation is smooth , but a very small sound while rotating. A person who is standing near to camera can notice this sound
7. Zooming is ok , but no optical zoom
8. Night vision is good
9. You can add presets and presets are working good. I am specifically telling this because presets won't work well in some other brand cameraz . But for tapo it is working very good.

10. You can adjust rotation angle and it is one of the feature missing in other camera.

11. Person detection is working well and you can easily differtiate normal motion detection with person detection by a person symbol on thumbnails.

Cons
1. Cloud storage is expensive
2. No optical zoom, only digital zoom. I didn't like zoom clarity compared to other 3mp models. If you want to zoom a large distance , don't take this.i own an ezviz 1k camera and i liked zoom clarity of that than this.
3. Can't control the siren as per our will.siren works only in motion detection. So if a small insect is flying , then it will make sound. But we can restrict it to human detection. I always prefer an alarm with a button which we can trigger from app.
4. Play back or recorded video in memory card fast-forward option is not via slider. You can select a speed and it will fast forward based on that. But I always prefer a slider for fast-forward.

5. Tapo is autorotating sometimes. Not sure why . I don't want this feature.
6. One major con I noticed is the wifi network updation . Most of the cameras now a days allow you to change wifi network via app . But for tapo we can't change wifi via app. I can see network selection is ready only field and no action on that.

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was skeptical when this camera was recommended to me. It looked both too easy to be of use, and too complicated to actually set up and use. I couldn't have been more wrong. This TP-Link Tapo security camera is just what I needed. I bought one to try and see, and the minute it was set up and I could see what it could do, Immediately ordered three more. It is an easy setup task, and the benefits of having them are so much more than I would have expected. They are also more affordable than I expected. I now have one in each of my main rooms, and I can see what's happening in my house from the office desk. I have yet to try to access my house through the camera from another country, but I have no doubt that it would work. I use it to make sure my pets are OK. The camera pans, tilts, has night vision, records, has a privacy mode, can be wall mounted or free standing, and I can talk through the camera, which will be a weight off my mind when I have to go abroad and need to see if my pet sitter is actually doing what has been asked of them. If I can feel like this about my pets, I can imagine how a parent might feel to be able to watch their children through them! I recommend these cameras with no hesitation. Just FYI - there is an option to sign up for a monthly payable cloud storage system for these cameras. But if you are not keen to do that, you have to buy a storage card to record what you need. (There is an option to turn on the privacy mode which means the cameras will only record if the privacy mode is switched off.)

We were out of town for few days and this camera is suppose to monitor the house, but unfortunately it worked for only two days. WiFi was working fine other cameras from Philips was doing their job. But this Tapo camera went offline and did nothing for rest of the time. I have enabled the auto restart setting on daily intervals, but I believe that didn’t work. Tried to reach out customer care, but they will not respond, and since the product is working fine and issue is intermittent, was not able to show to the customer care. Think before you buy. Go with Philips cameras as they support offline recordings, though they are bit costly.,shreyas

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cette caméra est un excellent choix pour ceux qui recherchent une solution de surveillance domestique efficace et abordable. Avec sa résolution 2K, la qualité d’image est impressionnante, offrant des vidéos nettes et claires, ce qui permet de capturer les moindres détails, même dans des conditions de faible luminosité. L’angle de vision de 360° et la possibilité de faire pivoter la caméra à distance via l’application Tapo ajoutent une flexibilité appréciable, permettant de couvrir une large zone avec un seul appareil.

L’installation est simple et rapide, même pour les moins technophiles. L’application Tapo est intuitive, rendant le contrôle de la caméra et l’accès aux vidéos enregistrées très faciles. De plus, la fonctionnalité de détection de mouvement et les notifications en temps réel sont très utiles pour rester informé de ce qui se passe chez soi.

Cependant, il y a quelques points à améliorer. Par exemple, la caméra nécessite une connexion Wi-Fi stable pour fonctionner de manière optimale, ce qui peut être un problème si le signal est faible. De plus, bien que la caméra soit livrée avec un emplacement pour carte microSD, le stockage en ligne est payant, ce qui peut représenter un coût supplémentaire à long terme.

En dépit de ces petits inconvénients, la Tapo 2K C210 reste un excellent rapport qualité-prix et je la recommande sans hésitation pour sécuriser votre domicile.

10. You can adjust rotation angle and it is one of the feature missing in other camera.

11. Person detection is working well and you can easily differtiate normal motion detection with person detection by a person symbol on thumbnails.

Cons
1. Cloud storage is expensive
2. No optical zoom, only digital zoom. I didn't like zoom clarity compared to other 3mp models. If you want to zoom a large distance , don't take this.i own an ezviz 1k camera and i liked zoom clarity of that than this.
3. Can't control the siren as per our will.siren works only in motion detection. So if a small insect is flying , then it will make sound. But we can restrict it to human detection. I always prefer an alarm with a button which we can trigger from app.
4. Play back or recorded video in memory card fast-forward option is not via slider. You can select a speed and it will fast forward based on that. But I always prefer a slider for fast-forward.

5. Tapo is autorotating sometimes. Not sure why . I don't want this feature.
6. One major con I noticed is the wifi network updation . Most of the cameras now a days allow you to change wifi network via app . But for tapo we can't change wifi via app. I can see network selection is ready only field and no action on that.

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was skeptical when this camera was recommended to me. It looked both too easy to be of use, and too complicated to actually set up and use. I couldn't have been more wrong. This TP-Link Tapo security camera is just what I needed. I bought one to try and see, and the minute it was set up and I could see what it could do, Immediately ordered three more. It is an easy setup task, and the benefits of having them are so much more than I would have expected. They are also more affordable than I expected. I now have one in each of my main rooms, and I can see what's happening in my house from the office desk. I have yet to try to access my house through the camera from another country, but I have no doubt that it would work. I use it to make sure my pets are OK. The camera pans, tilts, has night vision, records, has a privacy mode, can be wall mounted or free standing, and I can talk through the camera, which will be a weight off my mind when I have to go abroad and need to see if my pet sitter is actually doing what has been asked of them. If I can feel like this about my pets, I can imagine how a parent might feel to be able to watch their children through them! I recommend these cameras with no hesitation. Just FYI - there is an option to sign up for a monthly payable cloud storage system for these cameras. But if you are not keen to do that, you have to buy a storage card to record what you need. (There is an option to turn on the privacy mode which means the cameras will only record if the privacy mode is switched off.)

We were out of town for few days and this camera is suppose to monitor the house, but unfortunately it worked for only two days. WiFi was working fine other cameras from Philips was doing their job. But this Tapo camera went offline and did nothing for rest of the time. I have enabled the auto restart setting on daily intervals, but I believe that didn’t work. Tried to reach out customer care, but they will not respond, and since the product is working fine and issue is intermittent, was not able to show to the customer care. Think before you buy. Go with Philips cameras as they support offline recordings, though they are bit costly.,shreyas

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cette caméra est un excellent choix pour ceux qui recherchent une solution de surveillance domestique efficace et abordable. Avec sa résolution 2K, la qualité d’image est impressionnante, offrant des vidéos nettes et claires, ce qui permet de capturer les moindres détails, même dans des conditions de faible luminosité. L’angle de vision de 360° et la possibilité de faire pivoter la caméra à distance via l’application Tapo ajoutent une flexibilité appréciable, permettant de couvrir une large zone avec un seul appareil.

L’installation est simple et rapide, même pour les moins technophiles. L’application Tapo est intuitive, rendant le contrôle de la caméra et l’accès aux vidéos enregistrées très faciles. De plus, la fonctionnalité de détection de mouvement et les notifications en temps réel sont très utiles pour rester informé de ce qui se passe chez soi.

Cependant, il y a quelques points à améliorer. Par exemple, la caméra nécessite une connexion Wi-Fi stable pour fonctionner de manière optimale, ce qui peut être un problème si le signal est faible. De plus, bien que la caméra soit livrée avec un emplacement pour carte microSD, le stockage en ligne est payant, ce qui peut représenter un coût supplémentaire à long terme.

En dépit de ces petits inconvénients, la Tapo 2K C210 reste un excellent rapport qualité-prix et je la recommande sans hésitation pour sécuriser votre domicile.

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s been about 4 days since I got this product and I’m happy with it as a baby monitor so far. It was easy to set up. As it can rest on any flat surface, I didn’t need to install it anywhere but it comes with all the necessary accessories for a wall mount. But because of the flat design I can put it anywhere near my baby, and even if I move her to another room, I can take the camera with me. The 360° rotation is impressive and the video quality is great, especially since I use it on the phone mostly—even 480p is sufficient.

The best features are the sound and movement triggers. If my little one wakes up annd moves around and/or cries, notifications are sent to my phone and the feed is also recorded for that portion (in case you want to check what disturbed them). This is great if you need to be in another room—gives you peace of mind. In fact, the sound trigger feature is not available in other cameras in this price range so this was the main deciding factor for my choice. The live feed is definitely a boon to make sure baby is fine when you’re away from her. You can also zoom in on the live feed, which is a cool little feature that I was not expecting. Plus, with the recording feature, you get to have little memories of the baby waking up saved away for the future :)

The only feature I’ve not had a chance to test is night vision but some videos of this camera I saw on YouTube seem to show that this feature is solid in the camera.

Right now I’m on the Imou Life trial subscription because it’s free and will save all recordings to the cloud (up to 3 days). I’ll move to a micro SD soon though. Thinking of also getting a power bank to make it truly portable. Overall, this device is great value and I’d recommend it for parents looking for a baby monitor.

I am using it since 2 years and the performance is still decent. It has decent night vision and quality. It rotates 360° horizontally and 270° vertically. You can use sd card or buy their subscription for storage which I will talk about later. But!!! The most annoying thingಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ!!! Is actually it's software (⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)(⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)!!! I should write this thing in app's review but I think it should be added in product review too as it shows your experience using the product. So the first and major problem is that the app logs out every 3-4 days you don't use it which is very annoying. Imagine there is an emergency at your home and you need to turn on the camera ASAP, you open the app and boom!! Throw your emergency away and login here(⁠◠⁠ω◕⁠)!!
Also trust me, it is veryyy like very complicated and hard to login. The other issue is bro why do you even sell you products in India if you don't want to accept India's payment options. You can't use UPI apps it tells you to use paypal, bro seriously how the hell am I supposed to use paypal here or else use international cards :D!! And don't just use international cards but you have to buy the monthly subscription and trust me again it is very hard to cancel the subscription. I only need the camera twice or thrice a year so why should I waste my money in buying the subscription every month!?!??
Well this is my review it ends here.

You can use sd card or buy their subscription for storage which I will talk about later. But!!! The most annoying thingಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ!!! Is actually it's software (⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)(⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)!!! I should write this thing in app's review but I think it should be added in product review too as it shows your experience using the product. So the first and major problem is that the app logs out every 3-4 days you don't use it which is very annoying. Imagine there is an emergency at your home and you need to turn on the camera ASAP, you open the app and boom!! Throw your emergency away and login here(⁠◠⁠ω◕⁠)!!
Also trust me, it is veryyy like very complicated and hard to login. The other issue is bro why do you even sell you products in India if you don't want to accept India's payment options. You can't use UPI apps it tells you to use paypal, bro seriously how the hell am I supposed to use paypal here or else use international cards :D!! And don't just use international cards but you have to buy the monthly subscription and trust me again it is very hard to cancel the subscription. I only need the camera twice or thrice a year so why should I waste my money in buying the subscription every month!?!??
Well this is my review it ends here.

In first order the product had defect but when I contacted it's customer support they reverted immediately and was replaced in 2 days with new one. So they after service is also very good. Just one thing I am facing problem is SIREN is not playing properly it's getting stop in 2-3 seconds instead of 30 seconds. But overall product is fabulous in the price that is offered. Just go for it.,Amazon Customer

However, after just six months of light, home use by individuals weighing around 70-80 kg, one of the foot steps cracked, making it unsafe to use. This is disappointing for a product advertised as durable and capable of supporting much heavier weights. The quality feels subpar, and it’s clear the ladder isn’t built to withstand regular use. I wouldn’t recommend this product if you're looking for something reliable and long-lasting.,mani

Ozone Safe Locker for Home | Digital Lock | Safety Locker For Home | Non Motorized | Master & User PIN Code Access | Tijori Locker | Black | 16 Litres | 24 Months Warranty By Ozone (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,The secure locker arrived packaged in the branded box, cushioned on both sides with safety pads. However, the box lacked a proper seal, featuring only a simple cello tape adorned with the brand name. Setting up the safe proved to be straightforward, thanks to the provided instructions. It would have been beneficial if the instructions also covered setting the date and time, but I managed to navigate it by referring to their instructional YouTube video.

Upon opening the safe, I noticed it was disappointingly dirty. It's essential for the dispatch team to ensure cleanliness by removing paint, dust, and other debris before shipping the product. The carpet in the lower slot, while present, is inadequately glued and doesn't fit properly. Furthermore, the carpet piece's size does not match the dimensions, resulting in unsightly folds. The key is flimsy and seems generic, I am worried that any one with similar key can open the locker which totally defies the purpose of having the locker at first place.

The outer body of the safe is robust and well-constructed, seemingly made in India. However, my concern lies with the locking mechanism, which is made in China and appears flimsy. Only time will reveal the true durability of the safe. Additionally, the product seems slightly overpriced compared to competitors such as Amazon Basics safe lockers.

Despite these drawbacks, I recommend the product based on its overall performance and construction.

Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL (Modular,1 Piece),5.0 out of 5 stars,Firstly, the modular design of this broom is very convenient. It comes in 1 piece, making it easy to assemble and use. The handle is also adjustable, which is perfect for someone like me who is on the shorter side. I can adjust the handle to my desired length for comfortable sweeping. One of the main features that drew me to this broom was the promise of no dust. I have always struggled with traditional brooms leaving behind a trail of dust and debris. However, the Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL lives up to its name. The bristles are made of soft, fine fibers that effectively pick up all the dust and dirt without scattering it around. This has made sweeping a much cleaner and less messy task. Another great feature of this broom is its XL size. The broom head is wider than most traditional brooms, which means I can cover more surface area with each sweep. This has significantly reduced my cleaning time. The broom is also lightweight, making it easy to maneuver around furniture and corners. The quality of this broom is top-notch. The bristles are strong and durable, and they have not shown any signs of wear and tear even after multiple uses. The handle is also sturdy and feels comfortable to hold.,One Malabar Hill

Scotch-Brite Plastic Spin Mop Head and Handle (Suitable for Scotch-Brite 2 in 1 Spin Mop Only),3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this mop from Scotch Brite because I was frustrated with the Prestige ones, many of which now seem to be fake copies. Although this one is a bit pricey, it’s been working well after several months of use.

Pros:
1) The spin mechanism is effective; it dries quickly after just two spins.
2) The mopping material is decent and gets the job done, although it mops in patches due to the design.
3) It’s very easy to assemble.
4) You can buy just the mop stick alone if you already have a mop tub.

Cons:
1) The mop’s thread material is quite delicate. After the first wash, at least three strands came out, and a few more falls off with each use. And will continue for sure, I know.

Overall, I’m still using it. It’s average but functional for daily use.

Rushwak Bathroom Cleaning Brush with Wiper Upgraded 3 in 1 Toilet Brush Bathroom Brush with Long Handle 180° Rotate Bathroom Floor Cleaning Brush Bathroom Cleaning Accessories (Multicolor),5.0 out of 5 stars,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I recently purchased the bathroom cleaning brush with a wiper, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way possible! This product is a game-changer when it comes to keeping my bathroom spotless and gleaming.

First and foremost, the quality of this brush is outstanding. The bristles are sturdy and durable, ensuring they don't wear out quickly even with regular use. The handle is comfortable to grip, and the overall construction feels solid and well-made. I can tell that this brush is built to last, which makes it a fantastic investment for my cleaning arsenal.

The wiper feature is what truly sets this bathroom brush apart from others on the market. It's incredibly handy for wiping away excess water and cleaning solution, leaving my bathroom surfaces completely dry and streak-free. This saves me a lot of time and effort, as I don't have to reach for a separate cloth or paper towel to wipe down surfaces after scrubbing.

Cleaning with this brush is a breeze. The bristles do an excellent job of tackling tough stains and grime without scratching or damaging my bathroom fixtures. Plus, the wiper efficiently collects the residue, making the whole process more efficient and thorough.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with the bathroom cleaning brush with a wiper. Its impressive quality, efficient cleaning power, and convenient design have made my cleaning routine much more enjoyable. If you're looking for a top-notch bathroom cleaning tool, I highly recommend giving this brush a try. You won't be disappointed!

The video quality is too good and the setup is very easy. But the product needs lot of improvements which I am listing out below.
1. The tilt option is not that great and you can't focus the floor and door at the same time if it is installed above 5 feet high.
2. The 2 way talk option is just for name sake. The speaker quality is one of the worst one could imagine. You literally need to keep your ears in the camera to hear what the other one speaks.
3. Sound notifications and motion notifications are annoying which made me to disable them. Sound of crows and dogs far from home are detected (which happens all the time) and sends notifications. Similarly screen movements are sent as motion detection notifications. Detection of Human voice and motion alone could have been helpful and solved the real need.
4. Onvif never works. It asks for Password reset but if I select that nothing happens but freezing.
5. Smart controls seems not working. I have scheduled things for eg. Switch on the recording when it is 8am. But it never started to record.
6. Also there is no option to automate recording like Stop recording from Night 8 to Morning 8 every day.
7. Option to view in PC is too naive. If I wanted to view the feeds from office (or other phone restricted place), I can't do that as I need to scan the QR shown by the webpage through the mobile app. Even then it hardly works/opens.

Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reasonable pricing and of the correct size for cleaning purposes. Easy to use and very practical.,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a reliable and effective cleaning solution that effortlessly balances form and function. With a sturdy build and thoughtful design, these sponges prove to be a versatile companion in tackling various cleaning tasks around the house.

The pack's inclusion of six sponges ensures an extended period of use, making it a cost-effective option for those who require a long-lasting cleaning tool. The dual-sided design, featuring a scrubbing side and a softer wiping side, offers the flexibility needed to address both stubborn stains and delicate surfaces. This adaptability proves especially handy in the kitchen, where grime and grease are common adversaries.

One of the standout features of these sponges is their durability. The scrubbing side effectively removes tough residue without wearing down too quickly, while the wiping side maintains its integrity through multiple uses. This robustness translates into fewer replacements and less waste, contributing to a more sustainable cleaning routine.

While the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge pack delivers on its promises, there is room for slight improvement. The scrubbing surface, while effective, may feel abrasive on more delicate items. Additionally, a greater variety of colors or patterns could add a touch of visual appeal to the utilitarian design.

In conclusion, the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a dependable and practical cleaning tool that shines in its ability to adapt to different cleaning challenges. Its longevity, dual-sided functionality, and overall durability make it a solid investment for anyone seeking a reliable cleaning companion. While some refinements could enhance its aesthetic appeal, its performance remains the true highlight. Say goodbye to stubborn stains and embrace the convenience of these scrub sponges in your cleaning arsenal.

CP PLUS 2MP Full HD Smart Wi-Fi CCTV Home Security Camera | 360° with Pan Tilt | View & Talk | Motion Alert | Night Vision | SD Card (Upto 128 GB), Alexa & Google Support | IR Distance 10mtr | CP-E25A,4.0 out of 5 stars,I was using TP Link's Tapo Camera and was pretty happy with that. But that camera is a mid range cam (which means it costs over 2.5k) and now I wanted something cheap. So I went for this CP Plus CP-E25A.

The camera does what its made for, and here are my observations:

*There is a significant lag (of around 3-4 seconds).
*The Camera does not offer 5ghz support over the WiFi. it only supports the basic 2.4Ghz.
* In my experience the camera keeps losing the wifi connection every now and often and it becomes really frustrating.
*The two way audio isnt working in my camera. I try talking into the mic, but no sound comes out from the camera speakers. But since I dont need it, I am not raising a complaint.
*The video quality is nothing to complain about. Its crisp and clear. Even the night vision is great.
*Although sometimes, the camera auto adjusts itself and moves around. You have to go and fix it through the app.
*The SD card supports loop recording. Thats a good thing.
*I found that the app is not as intuitive as Tapo's app.

So if you want a basic camera for just monitoring, go for it.

Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product to use for once and all. It is for day to day normal use and for normal stain utensils. Thank you.,S.S.
Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),4.0 out of 5 stars,Have always been purchasing the original scotch brite pads since they don't leave behind residue on the plates which we then inevitably digest while eating off plates. Because, let's face it, how much ever we wash the plates, there is always micro-residue from the cheap ripped off scrub pads in the market. The Scotch Brite scrub pads don't degrade like their cheap counterparts and hence last longer.
Price could be cheaper but then this is a premium product with the 3M logo. Gotta pay for the brand and the quality.,su-personic

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this product in May-2024, total 3 nos for my different bathroom showers. After almost 3 months of usage. I'm forced to post this review. So everything was fine till date. Even the filter was doing a good job. The problem comes when u want to replace the cartridge or u want to change the position of the cartridge. So 1st time I changed the direction of cartridge from the filter upside down. This is required to be done as per the company's instruction. It took hell lot of ime to do this job..I don't know why they have made this filter and cartridge assembly in such a bad design that u cannot remove the cartridge from the filter. I did this anyhow and second time I tried this today with another filter but the cartridge is not getting separated whatever I tried. If the manufacturer wanted to sell cartridge as a replacement or consumable item then it should have been user friendly. Even entire cartridge got damaged but it didn't come out. I am had Even purchased extra cartridge for this filter..it's a waste for me now..I don't know any other person faced the same problems but this is the worst design i must say. Again the filter is expensive around 2k..u cannot waste this much money for 3-4 months usage.i would request water science team to see this and help me out,Pranav Kankee

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had ordered 2 filters inspite of many bad reviews. One filter is working fine but second has water leaking from the body. Installation is easy but the key tool provided is useless to say the least.
Edit: the filter which was working fine was not used for 15 days and now it has choked. Water is not passing through it. Such useless products seems they are more reliant on paid reviews otherwise there is no explanation to generally good reviews when both the products i recieved were faulty,av123456

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this product in May-2024, total 3 nos for my different bathroom showers. After almost 3 months of usage. I'm forced to post this review. So everything was fine till date. Even the filter was doing a good job. The problem comes when u want to replace the cartridge or u want to change the position of the cartridge. So 1st time I changed the direction of cartridge from the filter upside down. This is required to be done as per the company's instruction. It took hell lot of ime to do this job..I don't know why they have made this filter and cartridge assembly in such a bad design that u cannot remove the cartridge from the filter. I did this anyhow and second time I tried this today with another filter but the cartridge is not getting separated whatever I tried. If the manufacturer wanted to sell cartridge as a replacement or consumable item then it should have been user friendly. Even entire cartridge got damaged but it didn't come out. I am had Even purchased extra cartridge for this filter..it's a waste for me now..I don't know any other person faced the same problems but this is the worst design i must say. Again the filter is expensive around 2k..u cannot waste this much money for 3-4 months usage.i would request water science team to see this and help me out,Pranav Kankee

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought two of this product for it's separate use, but one didn't work after a month seems like a the filter is blocked due to which the water is, since it's already passed refund schedule this been a waste of money for me 😞,Shiv
WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,5.0 out of 5 stars,This hard water filter works amazingly well. It's really helpful for people living in Pune since the water is very hard.

I found it super easy to install as they provide the installation kit and the connectors.

It's economical and have noticed improvement in the quality of water. Will update this review after few months of use.,Dinesh O V
WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,4.0 out of 5 stars,Does it's job well. Quality and manual is good. Spare connectors are helpful. Changing cartridge every 6 months is a task and cost involved.,P.L.Kori
WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had ordered 2 filters inspite of many bad reviews. One filter is working fine but second has water leaking from the body. Installation is easy but the key tool provided is useless to say the least.
Edit: the filter which was working fine was not used for 15 days and now it has choked. Water is not passing through it. Such useless products seems they are more reliant on paid reviews otherwise there is no explanation to generally good reviews when both the products i recieved were faulty,av123456

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s been about 4 days since I got this product and I’m happy with it as a baby monitor so far. It was easy to set up. As it can rest on any flat surface, I didn’t need to install it anywhere but it comes with all the necessary accessories for a wall mount. But because of the flat design I can put it anywhere near my baby, and even if I move her to another room, I can take the camera with me. The 360° rotation is impressive and the video quality is great, especially since I use it on the phone mostly—even 480p is sufficient.

The best features are the sound and movement triggers. If my little one wakes up annd moves around and/or cries, notifications are sent to my phone and the feed is also recorded for that portion (in case you want to check what disturbed them). This is great if you need to be in another room—gives you peace of mind. In fact, the sound trigger feature is not available in other cameras in this price range so this was the main deciding factor for my choice. The live feed is definitely a boon to make sure baby is fine when you’re away from her. You can also zoom in on the live feed, which is a cool little feature that I was not expecting. Plus, with the recording feature, you get to have little memories of the baby waking up saved away for the future :)

The only feature I’ve not had a chance to test is night vision but some videos of this camera I saw on YouTube seem to show that this feature is solid in the camera.

Right now I’m on the Imou Life trial subscription because it’s free and will save all recordings to the cloud (up to 3 days). I’ll move to a micro SD soon though. Thinking of also getting a power bank to make it truly portable. Overall, this device is great value and I’d recommend it for parents looking for a baby monitor.

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,3.0 out of 5 stars,The camera is really good. I am using it since 2 years and the performance is still decent. It has decent night vision and quality. It rotates 360° horizontally and 270° vertically. You can use sd card or buy their subscription for storage which I will talk about later. But!!! The most annoying thingಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ!!! Is actually it's software (⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)(⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)!!! I should write this thing in app's review but I think it should be added in product review too as it shows your experience using the product. So the first and major problem is that the app logs out every 3-4 days you don't use it which is very annoying. Imagine there is an emergency at your home and you need to turn on the camera ASAP, you open the app and boom!! Throw your emergency away and login here(⁠◠⁠ω◕⁠)!!
Also trust me, it is veryyy like very complicated and hard to login. The other issue is bro why do you even sell you products in India if you don't want to accept India's payment options. You can't use UPI apps it tells you to use paypal, bro seriously how the hell am I supposed to use paypal here or else use international cards :D!! And don't just use international cards but you have to buy the monthly subscription and trust me again it is very hard to cancel the subscription. I only need the camera twice or thrice a year so why should I waste my money in buying the subscription every month!?!??
Well this is my review it ends here.

You can use sd card or buy their subscription for storage which I will talk about later. But!!! The most annoying thingಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ!!! Is actually it's software (⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)(⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)!!! I should write this thing in app's review but I think it should be added in product review too as it shows your experience using the product. So the first and major problem is that the app logs out every 3-4 days you don't use it which is very annoying. Imagine there is an emergency at your home and you need to turn on the camera ASAP, you open the app and boom!! Throw your emergency away and login here(⁠◠⁠ω◕⁠)!!
Also trust me, it is veryyy like very complicated and hard to login. The other issue is bro why do you even sell you products in India if you don't want to accept India's payment options. You can't use UPI apps it tells you to use paypal, bro seriously how the hell am I supposed to use paypal here or else use international cards :D!! And don't just use international cards but you have to buy the monthly subscription and trust me again it is very hard to cancel the subscription. I only need the camera twice or thrice a year so why should I waste my money in buying the subscription every month!?!??
Well this is my review it ends here.

In first order the product had defect but when I contacted it's customer support they reverted immediately and was replaced in 2 days with new one. So they after service is also very good. Just one thing I am facing problem is SIREN is not playing properly it's getting stop in 2-3 seconds instead of 30 seconds. But overall product is fabulous in the price that is offered. Just go for it.,Amazon Customer

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,4.0 out of 5 stars,Updating my review after one month of use. No change in my rating and just updating more prons and cons

Pros
1. Good indoor camera for normal use.
2. Configuring is easy
3.Tapo app is responsive and working good
4. Video Clarity is ok
5. Sound is ok
6. Rotation is smooth , but a very small sound while rotating. A person who is standing near to camera can notice this sound
7. Zooming is ok , but no optical zoom
8. Night vision is good
9. You can add presets and presets are working good. I am specifically telling this because presets won't work well in some other brand cameraz . But for tapo it is working very good.

10. You can adjust rotation angle and it is one of the feature missing in other camera.

11. Person detection is working well and you can easily differtiate normal motion detection with person detection by a person symbol on thumbnails.

Cons
1. Cloud storage is expensive
2. No optical zoom, only digital zoom. I didn't like zoom clarity compared to other 3mp models. If you want to zoom a large distance , don't take this.i own an ezviz 1k camera and i liked zoom clarity of that than this.
3. Can't control the siren as per our will.siren works only in motion detection. So if a small insect is flying , then it will make sound. But we can restrict it to human detection. I always prefer an alarm with a button which we can trigger from app.
4. Play back or recorded video in memory card fast-forward option is not via slider. You can select a speed and it will fast forward based on that. But I always prefer a slider for fast-forward.

5. Tapo is autorotating sometimes. Not sure why . I don't want this feature.
6. One major con I noticed is the wifi network updation . Most of the cameras now a days allow you to change wifi network via app . But for tapo we can't change wifi via app. I can see network selection is ready only field and no action on that.

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was skeptical when this camera was recommended to me. It looked both too easy to be of use, and too complicated to actually set up and use. I couldn't have been more wrong. This TP-Link Tapo security camera is just what I needed. I bought one to try and see, and the minute it was set up and I could see what it could do, Immediately ordered three more. It is an easy setup task, and the benefits of having them are so much more than I would have expected. They are also more affordable than I expected. I now have one in each of my main rooms, and I can see what's happening in my house from the office desk. I have yet to try to access my house through the camera from another country, but I have no doubt that it would work. I use it to make sure my pets are OK. The camera pans, tilts, has night vision, records, has a privacy mode, can be wall mounted or free standing, and I can talk through the camera, which will be a weight off my mind when I have to go abroad and need to see if my pet sitter is actually doing what has been asked of them. If I can feel like this about my pets, I can imagine how a parent might feel to be able to watch their children through them! I recommend these cameras with no hesitation. Just FYI - there is an option to sign up for a monthly payable cloud storage system for these cameras. But if you are not keen to do that, you have to buy a storage card to record what you need. (There is an option to turn on the privacy mode which means the cameras will only record if the privacy mode is switched off.)

We were out of town for few days and this camera is suppose to monitor the house, but unfortunately it worked for only two days. WiFi was working fine other cameras from Philips was doing their job. But this Tapo camera went offline and did nothing for rest of the time. I have enabled the auto restart setting on daily intervals, but I believe that didn’t work. Tried to reach out customer care, but they will not respond, and since the product is working fine and issue is intermittent, was not able to show to the customer care. Think before you buy. Go with Philips cameras as they support offline recordings, though they are bit costly.,shreyas

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cette caméra est un excellent choix pour ceux qui recherchent une solution de surveillance domestique efficace et abordable. Avec sa résolution 2K, la qualité d’image est impressionnante, offrant des vidéos nettes et claires, ce qui permet de capturer les moindres détails, même dans des conditions de faible luminosité. L’angle de vision de 360° et la possibilité de faire pivoter la caméra à distance via l’application Tapo ajoutent une flexibilité appréciable, permettant de couvrir une large zone avec un seul appareil.

L’installation est simple et rapide, même pour les moins technophiles. L’application Tapo est intuitive, rendant le contrôle de la caméra et l’accès aux vidéos enregistrées très faciles. De plus, la fonctionnalité de détection de mouvement et les notifications en temps réel sont très utiles pour rester informé de ce qui se passe chez soi.

Cependant, il y a quelques points à améliorer. Par exemple, la caméra nécessite une connexion Wi-Fi stable pour fonctionner de manière optimale, ce qui peut être un problème si le signal est faible. De plus, bien que la caméra soit livrée avec un emplacement pour carte microSD, le stockage en ligne est payant, ce qui peut représenter un coût supplémentaire à long terme.

En dépit de ces petits inconvénients, la Tapo 2K C210 reste un excellent rapport qualité-prix et je la recommande sans hésitation pour sécuriser votre domicile.

Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),1.0 out of 5 stars,This product could have been so much more. It has the brush, it has the stand, and it has the mobility. However, because you cannot keep it in a static position, it simply pivots whenever pressure it applied. Because of this "feature," you cannot clean anything with sufficient amounts of force.

However, because you cannot keep it in a static position, it simply pivots whenever pressure it applied. Because of this "feature," you cannot clean anything with sufficient amounts of force.

The idea is good. But the execution is lacking. Avoid!,Sunny

Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL (Modular,1 Piece),5.0 out of 5 stars,Firstly, the modular design of this broom is very convenient. It comes in 1 piece, making it easy to assemble and use. The handle is also adjustable, which is perfect for someone like me who is on the shorter side. I can adjust the handle to my desired length for comfortable sweeping. One of the main features that drew me to this broom was the promise of no dust. I have always struggled with traditional brooms leaving behind a trail of dust and debris. However, the Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL lives up to its name. The bristles are made of soft, fine fibers that effectively pick up all the dust and dirt without scattering it around. This has made sweeping a much cleaner and less messy task. Another great feature of this broom is its XL size. The broom head is wider than most traditional brooms, which means I can cover more surface area with each sweep. This has significantly reduced my cleaning time. The broom is also lightweight, making it easy to maneuver around furniture and corners. The quality of this broom is top-notch. The bristles are strong and durable, and they have not shown any signs of wear and tear even after multiple uses. The handle is also sturdy and feels comfortable to hold.,One Malabar Hill

Like if there is no internet connection it won't work, won't even record locally on the sd card. Why? This could be fixed via a software update but even on my previous mi camera, it hasn't been fixed for over 2 years now.
Also the Surveillance section in the app shows "No videos yet" even though there are videos. The video player just doesn't play them. I have an older mi 2i camera in the same app where this feature works perfectly.,Vijender Singh

Ozone Safe Locker for Home | Digital Lock | Safety Locker For Home | Non Motorized | Master & User PIN Code Access | Tijori Locker | Black | 16 Litres | 24 Months Warranty By Ozone (Black),1.0 out of 5 stars,It was a total waste of money. When the locker arrived the keys were missing after contacting the Amazon customer care & ozone customer care they kept redirecting me to one another. Also the installation was cancelled. I’m still waiting for them to help with the issue. They just seem to care about it.,Received a cracked Tv 📺 horrible service. After sending several emails and complaints no response from the team.Unbelievable

Ozone Safe Locker for Home | Digital Lock | Safety Locker For Home | Non Motorized | Master & User PIN Code Access | Tijori Locker | Black | 16 Litres | 24 Months Warranty By Ozone (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,The secure locker arrived packaged in the branded box, cushioned on both sides with safety pads. However, the box lacked a proper seal, featuring only a simple cello tape adorned with the brand name. Setting up the safe proved to be straightforward, thanks to the provided instructions. It would have been beneficial if the instructions also covered setting the date and time, but I managed to navigate it by referring to their instructional YouTube video.

Upon opening the safe, I noticed it was disappointingly dirty. It's essential for the dispatch team to ensure cleanliness by removing paint, dust, and other debris before shipping the product. The carpet in the lower slot, while present, is inadequately glued and doesn't fit properly. Furthermore, the carpet piece's size does not match the dimensions, resulting in unsightly folds. The key is flimsy and seems generic, I am worried that any one with similar key can open the locker which totally defies the purpose of having the locker at first place.

The outer body of the safe is robust and well-constructed, seemingly made in India. However, my concern lies with the locking mechanism, which is made in China and appears flimsy. Only time will reveal the true durability of the safe. Additionally, the product seems slightly overpriced compared to competitors such as Amazon Basics safe lockers.

Despite these drawbacks, I recommend the product based on its overall performance and construction.

Ozone Safe Locker for Home | Digital Lock | Safety Locker For Home | Non Motorized | Master & User PIN Code Access | Tijori Locker | Black | 16 Litres | 24 Months Warranty By Ozone (Black),1.0 out of 5 stars,It was a total waste of money. When the locker arrived the keys were missing after contacting the Amazon customer care & ozone customer care they kept redirecting me to one another. Also the installation was cancelled. I’m still waiting for them to help with the issue. They just seem to care about it.,Received a cracked Tv 📺 horrible service. After sending several emails and complaints no response from the team.Unbelievable
Ozone Safe Locker for Home | Digital Lock | Safety Locker For Home | Non Motorized | Master & User PIN Code Access | Tijori Locker | Black | 16 Litres | 24 Months Warranty By Ozone (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,The product is good and services and responses to query was excellent excellent. I had lost my keys. The company guy Mahesh visited immediately and resolved the issue.,SAHANA
Ozone Safe Locker for Home | Digital Lock | Safety Locker For Home | Non Motorized | Master & User PIN Code Access | Tijori Locker | Black | 16 Litres | 24 Months Warranty By Ozone (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,The secure locker arrived packaged in the branded box, cushioned on both sides with safety pads. However, the box lacked a proper seal, featuring only a simple cello tape adorned with the brand name. Setting up the safe proved to be straightforward, thanks to the provided instructions. It would have been beneficial if the instructions also covered setting the date and time, but I managed to navigate it by referring to their instructional YouTube video.

Upon opening the safe, I noticed it was disappointingly dirty. It's essential for the dispatch team to ensure cleanliness by removing paint, dust, and other debris before shipping the product. The carpet in the lower slot, while present, is inadequately glued and doesn't fit properly. Furthermore, the carpet piece's size does not match the dimensions, resulting in unsightly folds. The key is flimsy and seems generic, I am worried that any one with similar key can open the locker which totally defies the purpose of having the locker at first place.

The outer body of the safe is robust and well-constructed, seemingly made in India. However, my concern lies with the locking mechanism, which is made in China and appears flimsy. Only time will reveal the true durability of the safe. Additionally, the product seems slightly overpriced compared to competitors such as Amazon Basics safe lockers.

Despite these drawbacks, I recommend the product based on its overall performance and construction.

Scotch-Brite Plastic Spin Mop Head and Handle (Suitable for Scotch-Brite 2 in 1 Spin Mop Only),3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this mop from Scotch Brite because I was frustrated with the Prestige ones, many of which now seem to be fake copies. Although this one is a bit pricey, it’s been working well after several months of use.

Pros:
1) The spin mechanism is effective; it dries quickly after just two spins.
2) The mopping material is decent and gets the job done, although it mops in patches due to the design.
3) It’s very easy to assemble.
4) You can buy just the mop stick alone if you already have a mop tub.

Cons:
1) The mop’s thread material is quite delicate. After the first wash, at least three strands came out, and a few more falls off with each use. And will continue for sure, I know.

Overall, I’m still using it. It’s average but functional for daily use.

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this bottle cleaner. This is the second one I have ordered. I have kept one each at my home and my in law's place. It does the job. It does reach the bottom corners of the bottles as claimed. Overall a good one. I use it mostly for the kids bottles. It has a good reach. It dries quickly once you shake off as much water as you can.
The sponge is detachable from the handle as mentioned in the product description, to enable it to be changed once the sponge weras out. Now I haven't checked if the sponge head is available separately. Otherwise this is a bit expensive.,Mom to an autistic kid.
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,The scrubber given is very good and it cleans the milk residue properly , the only issue is that the handle detaches and the scrubber stays the bottle which is very hard to remove,Udayani

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this bottle cleaner for cleaning steel water bottle. I was facing issue with local brushes where the sponge on the lower part of the brush would get off quickly creating issues in cleaning the bottom of the bottle from inside. Did purchase this product with the hopes that it would solve this issue and the product delivered true to my expectations.

The only downside I see is that if the mouth of the bottle is a bit smaller, there can be issues in getting the brush outside without the risk of cleaning brush stuck inside the bottle.,Shantanu
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,Getting the perfect bottle cleaning brush is a hard task for Mommies.

The video quality is too good and the setup is very easy. But the product needs lot of improvements which I am listing out below.
1. The tilt option is not that great and you can't focus the floor and door at the same time if it is installed above 5 feet high.
2. The 2 way talk option is just for name sake. The speaker quality is one of the worst one could imagine. You literally need to keep your ears in the camera to hear what the other one speaks.
3. Sound notifications and motion notifications are annoying which made me to disable them. Sound of crows and dogs far from home are detected (which happens all the time) and sends notifications. Similarly screen movements are sent as motion detection notifications. Detection of Human voice and motion alone could have been helpful and solved the real need.
4. Onvif never works. It asks for Password reset but if I select that nothing happens but freezing.
5. Smart controls seems not working. I have scheduled things for eg. Switch on the recording when it is 8am. But it never started to record.
6. Also there is no option to automate recording like Stop recording from Night 8 to Morning 8 every day.
7. Option to view in PC is too naive. If I wanted to view the feeds from office (or other phone restricted place), I can't do that as I need to scan the QR shown by the webpage through the mobile app. Even then it hardly works/opens.

Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a reliable and effective cleaning solution that effortlessly balances form and function. With a sturdy build and thoughtful design, these sponges prove to be a versatile companion in tackling various cleaning tasks around the house.

The pack's inclusion of six sponges ensures an extended period of use, making it a cost-effective option for those who require a long-lasting cleaning tool. The dual-sided design, featuring a scrubbing side and a softer wiping side, offers the flexibility needed to address both stubborn stains and delicate surfaces. This adaptability proves especially handy in the kitchen, where grime and grease are common adversaries.

One of the standout features of these sponges is their durability. The scrubbing side effectively removes tough residue without wearing down too quickly, while the wiping side maintains its integrity through multiple uses. This robustness translates into fewer replacements and less waste, contributing to a more sustainable cleaning routine.

While the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge pack delivers on its promises, there is room for slight improvement. The scrubbing surface, while effective, may feel abrasive on more delicate items. Additionally, a greater variety of colors or patterns could add a touch of visual appeal to the utilitarian design.

In conclusion, the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a dependable and practical cleaning tool that shines in its ability to adapt to different cleaning challenges. Its longevity, dual-sided functionality, and overall durability make it a solid investment for anyone seeking a reliable cleaning companion. While some refinements could enhance its aesthetic appeal, its performance remains the true highlight.

Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product to use for once and all. It is for day to day normal use and for normal stain utensils. Thank you.,S.S.
Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),4.0 out of 5 stars,Have always been purchasing the original scotch brite pads since they don't leave behind residue on the plates which we then inevitably digest while eating off plates. Because, let's face it, how much ever we wash the plates, there is always micro-residue from the cheap ripped off scrub pads in the market. The Scotch Brite scrub pads don't degrade like their cheap counterparts and hence last longer.
Price could be cheaper but then this is a premium product with the 3M logo. Gotta pay for the brand and the quality.,su-personic

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this product in May-2024, total 3 nos for my different bathroom showers. After almost 3 months of usage. I'm forced to post this review. So everything was fine till date. Even the filter was doing a good job. The problem comes when u want to replace the cartridge or u want to change the position of the cartridge. So 1st time I changed the direction of cartridge from the filter upside down. This is required to be done as per the company's instruction. It took hell lot of ime to do this job..I don't know why they have made this filter and cartridge assembly in such a bad design that u cannot remove the cartridge from the filter. I did this anyhow and second time I tried this today with another filter but the cartridge is not getting separated whatever I tried. If the manufacturer wanted to sell cartridge as a replacement or consumable item then it should have been user friendly. Even entire cartridge got damaged but it didn't come out. I am had Even purchased extra cartridge for this filter..it's a waste for me now..I don't know any other person faced the same problems but this is the worst design i must say. Again the filter is expensive around 2k..u cannot waste this much money for 3-4 months usage.i would request water science team to see this and help me out,Pranav Kankee

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s been about 4 days since I got this product and I’m happy with it as a baby monitor so far. It was easy to set up. As it can rest on any flat surface, I didn’t need to install it anywhere but it comes with all the necessary accessories for a wall mount. But because of the flat design I can put it anywhere near my baby, and even if I move her to another room, I can take the camera with me. The 360° rotation is impressive and the video quality is great, especially since I use it on the phone mostly—even 480p is sufficient.

The best features are the sound and movement triggers. If my little one wakes up annd moves around and/or cries, notifications are sent to my phone and the feed is also recorded for that portion (in case you want to check what disturbed them). This is great if you need to be in another room—gives you peace of mind. In fact, the sound trigger feature is not available in other cameras in this price range so this was the main deciding factor for my choice. The live feed is definitely a boon to make sure baby is fine when you’re away from her. You can also zoom in on the live feed, which is a cool little feature that I was not expecting. Plus, with the recording feature, you get to have little memories of the baby waking up saved away for the future :)

The only feature I’ve not had a chance to test is night vision but some videos of this camera I saw on YouTube seem to show that this feature is solid in the camera.

Right now I’m on the Imou Life trial subscription because it’s free and will save all recordings to the cloud (up to 3 days). I’ll move to a micro SD soon though. Thinking of also getting a power bank to make it truly portable. Overall, this device is great value and I’d recommend it for parents looking for a baby monitor.

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,3.0 out of 5 stars,The camera is really good. I am using it since 2 years and the performance is still decent. It has decent night vision and quality. It rotates 360° horizontally and 270° vertically. You can use sd card or buy their subscription for storage which I will talk about later. But!!! The most annoying thingಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ!!! Is actually it's software (⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)(⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)!!! I should write this thing in app's review but I think it should be added in product review too as it shows your experience using the product. So the first and major problem is that the app logs out every 3-4 days you don't use it which is very annoying. Imagine there is an emergency at your home and you need to turn on the camera ASAP, you open the app and boom!! Throw your emergency away and login here(⁠◠⁠ω◕⁠)!!
Also trust me, it is veryyy like very complicated and hard to login. The other issue is bro why do you even sell you products in India if you don't want to accept India's payment options. You can't use UPI apps it tells you to use paypal, bro seriously how the hell am I supposed to use paypal here or else use international cards :D!! And don't just use international cards but you have to buy the monthly subscription and trust me again it is very hard to cancel the subscription. I only need the camera twice or thrice a year so why should I waste my money in buying the subscription every month!?!??
Well this is my review it ends here.

Night vision: very good
Wireless connectivity: good
Detection: very good.
Notification: very good
Feature: All required features are available.
Bad: when to talk, camera sound quality need to improve. Meaning camera sound system need to improve. But sound captured by camre is very good.
Alarm: good,Rajdeep Sen
Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,4.0 out of 5 stars,Updating my review after one month of use. No change in my rating and just updating more prons and cons

Pros
1. Good indoor camera for normal use.
2. Configuring is easy
3.Tapo app is responsive and working good
4. Video Clarity is ok
5. Sound is ok
6. Rotation is smooth , but a very small sound while rotating. A person who is standing near to camera can notice this sound
7. Zooming is ok , but no optical zoom
8. Night vision is good
9. You can add presets and presets are working good. I am specifically telling this because presets won't work well in some other brand cameraz . But for tapo it is working very good.

10. You can adjust rotation angle and it is one of the feature missing in other camera.

11. Person detection is working well and you can easily differtiate normal motion detection with person detection by a person symbol on thumbnails.

Cons
1. Cloud storage is expensive
2. No optical zoom, only digital zoom. I didn't like zoom clarity compared to other 3mp models. If you want to zoom a large distance , don't take this.i own an ezviz 1k camera and i liked zoom clarity of that than this.
3. Can't control the siren as per our will.siren works only in motion detection. So if a small insect is flying , then it will make sound. But we can restrict it to human detection. I always prefer an alarm with a button which we can trigger from app.
4. Play back or recorded video in memory card fast-forward option is not via slider. You can select a speed and it will fast forward based on that. But I always prefer a slider for fast-forward.

5. Tapo is autorotating sometimes. Not sure why . I don't want this feature.
6. One major con I noticed is the wifi network updation . Most of the cameras now a days allow you to change wifi network via app . But for tapo we can't change wifi via app. I can see network selection is ready only field and no action on that.

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was skeptical when this camera was recommended to me. It looked both too easy to be of use, and too complicated to actually set up and use. I couldn't have been more wrong. This TP-Link Tapo security camera is just what I needed. I bought one to try and see, and the minute it was set up and I could see what it could do, Immediately ordered three more. It is an easy setup task, and the benefits of having them are so much more than I would have expected. They are also more affordable than I expected. I now have one in each of my main rooms, and I can see what's happening in my house from the office desk. I have yet to try to access my house through the camera from another country, but I have no doubt that it would work. I use it to make sure my pets are OK. The camera pans, tilts, has night vision, records, has a privacy mode, can be wall mounted or free standing, and I can talk through the camera, which will be a weight off my mind when I have to go abroad and need to see if my pet sitter is actually doing what has been asked of them. If I can feel like this about my pets, I can imagine how a parent might feel to be able to watch their children through them! I recommend these cameras with no hesitation. Just FYI - there is an option to sign up for a monthly payable cloud storage system for these cameras. But if you are not keen to do that, you have to buy a storage card to record what you need. (There is an option to turn on the privacy mode which means the cameras will only record if the privacy mode is switched off.)

We were out of town for few days and this camera is suppose to monitor the house, but unfortunately it worked for only two days. WiFi was working fine other cameras from Philips was doing their job. But this Tapo camera went offline and did nothing for rest of the time. I have enabled the auto restart setting on daily intervals, but I believe that didn’t work. Tried to reach out customer care, but they will not respond, and since the product is working fine and issue is intermittent, was not able to show to the customer care. Think before you buy. Go with Philips cameras as they support offline recordings, though they are bit costly.,shreyas

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cette caméra est un excellent choix pour ceux qui recherchent une solution de surveillance domestique efficace et abordable. Avec sa résolution 2K, la qualité d’image est impressionnante, offrant des vidéos nettes et claires, ce qui permet de capturer les moindres détails, même dans des conditions de faible luminosité. L’angle de vision de 360° et la possibilité de faire pivoter la caméra à distance via l’application Tapo ajoutent une flexibilité appréciable, permettant de couvrir une large zone avec un seul appareil.

L’installation est simple et rapide, même pour les moins technophiles. L’application Tapo est intuitive, rendant le contrôle de la caméra et l’accès aux vidéos enregistrées très faciles. De plus, la fonctionnalité de détection de mouvement et les notifications en temps réel sont très utiles pour rester informé de ce qui se passe chez soi.

Cependant, il y a quelques points à améliorer. Par exemple, la caméra nécessite une connexion Wi-Fi stable pour fonctionner de manière optimale, ce qui peut être un problème si le signal est faible. De plus, bien que la caméra soit livrée avec un emplacement pour carte microSD, le stockage en ligne est payant, ce qui peut représenter un coût supplémentaire à long terme.

En dépit de ces petits inconvénients, la Tapo 2K C210 reste un excellent rapport qualité-prix et je la recommande sans hésitation pour sécuriser votre domicile.

-Telefon ile uzaktan bağlanarak kamerayı hareket ettirme
-Telefon ile uzaktan karşılıklı konuşma
-Telefon ile uzaktan bağlanarak sd kartta kayıtlı dosyaları telefona indirme
-Kameranın hareket takibi ve telefona anlık bildirim göndermesi
-Telefona kısayol ekleyip evden çıkarken basıyorsunuz kamera çalışmaya başlıyor eve geldiğinizde eve geldim kısayoluna basıyorsunuz ve kamera ev moduna geçiyor.

Gerçekten çok güzel bir cihaz. Görüntü kalitesi ve cihaz kalitesi gayet iyi.

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,4.0 out of 5 stars,Updating my review after one month of use. No change in my rating and just updating more prons and cons

Pros
1. Good indoor camera for normal use.
2. Configuring is easy
3.Tapo app is responsive and working good
4. Video Clarity is ok
5. Sound is ok
6. Rotation is smooth , but a very small sound while rotating. A person who is standing near to camera can notice this sound
7. Zooming is ok , but no optical zoom
8. Night vision is good
9. You can add presets and presets are working good. I am specifically telling this because presets won't work well in some other brand cameraz . But for tapo it is working very good.

10. You can adjust rotation angle and it is one of the feature missing in other camera.

11. Person detection is working well and you can easily differtiate normal motion detection with person detection by a person symbol on thumbnails.

Cons
1. Cloud storage is expensive
2. No optical zoom, only digital zoom. I didn't like zoom clarity compared to other 3mp models. If you want to zoom a large distance , don't take this.i own an ezviz 1k camera and i liked zoom clarity of that than this.
3. Can't control the siren as per our will.siren works only in motion detection. So if a small insect is flying , then it will make sound. But we can restrict it to human detection. I always prefer an alarm with a button which we can trigger from app.
4. Play back or recorded video in memory card fast-forward option is not via slider. You can select a speed and it will fast forward based on that. But I always prefer a slider for fast-forward.

5. Tapo is autorotating sometimes. Not sure why . I don't want this feature.
6. One major con I noticed is the wifi network updation . Most of the cameras now a days allow you to change wifi network via app . But for tapo we can't change wifi via app. I can see network selection is ready only field and no action on that.

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was skeptical when this camera was recommended to me. It looked both too easy to be of use, and too complicated to actually set up and use. I couldn't have been more wrong. This TP-Link Tapo security camera is just what I needed. I bought one to try and see, and the minute it was set up and I could see what it could do, Immediately ordered three more. It is an easy setup task, and the benefits of having them are so much more than I would have expected. They are also more affordable than I expected. I now have one in each of my main rooms, and I can see what's happening in my house from the office desk. I have yet to try to access my house through the camera from another country, but I have no doubt that it would work. I use it to make sure my pets are OK. The camera pans, tilts, has night vision, records, has a privacy mode, can be wall mounted or free standing, and I can talk through the camera, which will be a weight off my mind when I have to go abroad and need to see if my pet sitter is actually doing what has been asked of them. If I can feel like this about my pets, I can imagine how a parent might feel to be able to watch their children through them! I recommend these cameras with no hesitation. Just FYI - there is an option to sign up for a monthly payable cloud storage system for these cameras. But if you are not keen to do that, you have to buy a storage card to record what you need. (There is an option to turn on the privacy mode which means the cameras will only record if the privacy mode is switched off.)

We were out of town for few days and this camera is suppose to monitor the house, but unfortunately it worked for only two days. WiFi was working fine other cameras from Philips was doing their job. But this Tapo camera went offline and did nothing for rest of the time. I have enabled the auto restart setting on daily intervals, but I believe that didn’t work. Tried to reach out customer care, but they will not respond, and since the product is working fine and issue is intermittent, was not able to show to the customer care. Think before you buy. Go with Philips cameras as they support offline recordings, though they are bit costly.,shreyas

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cette caméra est un excellent choix pour ceux qui recherchent une solution de surveillance domestique efficace et abordable. Avec sa résolution 2K, la qualité d’image est impressionnante, offrant des vidéos nettes et claires, ce qui permet de capturer les moindres détails, même dans des conditions de faible luminosité. L’angle de vision de 360° et la possibilité de faire pivoter la caméra à distance via l’application Tapo ajoutent une flexibilité appréciable, permettant de couvrir une large zone avec un seul appareil.

L’installation est simple et rapide, même pour les moins technophiles. L’application Tapo est intuitive, rendant le contrôle de la caméra et l’accès aux vidéos enregistrées très faciles. De plus, la fonctionnalité de détection de mouvement et les notifications en temps réel sont très utiles pour rester informé de ce qui se passe chez soi.

Cependant, il y a quelques points à améliorer. Par exemple, la caméra nécessite une connexion Wi-Fi stable pour fonctionner de manière optimale, ce qui peut être un problème si le signal est faible. De plus, bien que la caméra soit livrée avec un emplacement pour carte microSD, le stockage en ligne est payant, ce qui peut représenter un coût supplémentaire à long terme.

En dépit de ces petits inconvénients, la Tapo 2K C210 reste un excellent rapport qualité-prix et je la recommande sans hésitation pour sécuriser votre domicile.

Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),3.0 out of 5 stars,The base is not stable by design. It swivels uncontrollably, and will fold over while scrubbing. So it is not possible to scrub without interruptions.

Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL (Modular,1 Piece),5.0 out of 5 stars,Firstly, the modular design of this broom is very convenient. It comes in 1 piece, making it easy to assemble and use. The handle is also adjustable, which is perfect for someone like me who is on the shorter side. I can adjust the handle to my desired length for comfortable sweeping. One of the main features that drew me to this broom was the promise of no dust. I have always struggled with traditional brooms leaving behind a trail of dust and debris. However, the Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL lives up to its name. The bristles are made of soft, fine fibers that effectively pick up all the dust and dirt without scattering it around. This has made sweeping a much cleaner and less messy task. Another great feature of this broom is its XL size. The broom head is wider than most traditional brooms, which means I can cover more surface area with each sweep. This has significantly reduced my cleaning time. The broom is also lightweight, making it easy to maneuver around furniture and corners. The quality of this broom is top-notch. The bristles are strong and durable, and they have not shown any signs of wear and tear even after multiple uses. The handle is also sturdy and feels comfortable to hold.,One Malabar Hill

Scotch-Brite Plastic Spin Mop Head and Handle (Suitable for Scotch-Brite 2 in 1 Spin Mop Only),3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this mop from Scotch Brite because I was frustrated with the Prestige ones, many of which now seem to be fake copies. Although this one is a bit pricey, it’s been working well after several months of use.

Pros:
1) The spin mechanism is effective; it dries quickly after just two spins.
2) The mopping material is decent and gets the job done, although it mops in patches due to the design.
3) It’s very easy to assemble.
4) You can buy just the mop stick alone if you already have a mop tub.

Cons:
1) The mop’s thread material is quite delicate. After the first wash, at least three strands came out, and a few more falls off with each use. And will continue for sure, I know.

Overall, I’m still using it. It’s average but functional for daily use.

Scotch-Brite Plastic Spin Mop Head and Handle (Suitable for Scotch-Brite 2 in 1 Spin Mop Only),3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this mop from Scotch Brite because I was frustrated with the Prestige ones, many of which now seem to be fake copies. Although this one is a bit pricey, it’s been working well after several months of use.

Pros:
1) The spin mechanism is effective; it dries quickly after just two spins.
2) The mopping material is decent and gets the job done, although it mops in patches due to the design.
3) It’s very easy to assemble.
4) You can buy just the mop stick alone if you already have a mop tub.

Cons:
1) The mop’s thread material is quite delicate. After the first wash, at least three strands came out, and a few more falls off with each use. And will continue for sure, I know.

Overall, I’m still using it. It’s average but functional for daily use.

Ozone Safe Locker for Home | Digital Lock | Safety Locker For Home | Non Motorized | Master & User PIN Code Access | Tijori Locker | Black | 16 Litres | 24 Months Warranty By Ozone (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,The secure locker arrived packaged in the branded box, cushioned on both sides with safety pads. However, the box lacked a proper seal, featuring only a simple cello tape adorned with the brand name. Setting up the safe proved to be straightforward, thanks to the provided instructions. It would have been beneficial if the instructions also covered setting the date and time, but I managed to navigate it by referring to their instructional YouTube video.

Upon opening the safe, I noticed it was disappointingly dirty. It's essential for the dispatch team to ensure cleanliness by removing paint, dust, and other debris before shipping the product. The carpet in the lower slot, while present, is inadequately glued and doesn't fit properly. Furthermore, the carpet piece's size does not match the dimensions, resulting in unsightly folds. The key is flimsy and seems generic, I am worried that any one with similar key can open the locker which totally defies the purpose of having the locker at first place.

The outer body of the safe is robust and well-constructed, seemingly made in India. However, my concern lies with the locking mechanism, which is made in China and appears flimsy. Only time will reveal the true durability of the safe. Additionally, the product seems slightly overpriced compared to competitors such as Amazon Basics safe lockers.

Despite these drawbacks, I recommend the product based on its overall performance and construction.

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this bottle cleaner. This is the second one I have ordered. I have kept one each at my home and my in law's place. It does the job. It does reach the bottom corners of the bottles as claimed. Overall a good one. I use it mostly for the kids bottles. It has a good reach. It dries quickly once you shake off as much water as you can.
The sponge is detachable from the handle as mentioned in the product description, to enable it to be changed once the sponge weras out. Now I haven't checked if the sponge head is available separately. Otherwise this is a bit expensive.,Mom to an autistic kid.
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,The scrubber given is very good and it cleans the milk residue properly , the only issue is that the handle detaches and the scrubber stays the bottle which is very hard to remove,Udayani

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this bottle cleaner for cleaning steel water bottle. I was facing issue with local brushes where the sponge on the lower part of the brush would get off quickly creating issues in cleaning the bottom of the bottle from inside. Did purchase this product with the hopes that it would solve this issue and the product delivered true to my expectations.

The only downside I see is that if the mouth of the bottle is a bit smaller, there can be issues in getting the brush outside without the risk of cleaning brush stuck inside the bottle.,Shantanu
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,Getting the perfect bottle cleaning brush is a hard task for Mommies.

The video quality is too good and the setup is very easy. But the product needs lot of improvements which I am listing out below.
1. The tilt option is not that great and you can't focus the floor and door at the same time if it is installed above 5 feet high.
2. The 2 way talk option is just for name sake. The speaker quality is one of the worst one could imagine. You literally need to keep your ears in the camera to hear what the other one speaks.
3. Sound notifications and motion notifications are annoying which made me to disable them. Sound of crows and dogs far from home are detected (which happens all the time) and sends notifications. Similarly screen movements are sent as motion detection notifications. Detection of Human voice and motion alone could have been helpful and solved the real need.
4. Onvif never works. It asks for Password reset but if I select that nothing happens but freezing.
5. Smart controls seems not working. I have scheduled things for eg. Switch on the recording when it is 8am. But it never started to record.
6. Also there is no option to automate recording like Stop recording from Night 8 to Morning 8 every day.
7. Option to view in PC is too naive. If I wanted to view the feeds from office (or other phone restricted place), I can't do that as I need to scan the QR shown by the webpage through the mobile app. Even then it hardly works/opens.

Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reasonable pricing and of the correct size for cleaning purposes. Easy to use and very practical.,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a reliable and effective cleaning solution that effortlessly balances form and function. With a sturdy build and thoughtful design, these sponges prove to be a versatile companion in tackling various cleaning tasks around the house.

The pack's inclusion of six sponges ensures an extended period of use, making it a cost-effective option for those who require a long-lasting cleaning tool. The dual-sided design, featuring a scrubbing side and a softer wiping side, offers the flexibility needed to address both stubborn stains and delicate surfaces. This adaptability proves especially handy in the kitchen, where grime and grease are common adversaries.

One of the standout features of these sponges is their durability. The scrubbing side effectively removes tough residue without wearing down too quickly, while the wiping side maintains its integrity through multiple uses. This robustness translates into fewer replacements and less waste, contributing to a more sustainable cleaning routine.

While the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge pack delivers on its promises, there is room for slight improvement. The scrubbing surface, while effective, may feel abrasive on more delicate items. Additionally, a greater variety of colors or patterns could add a touch of visual appeal to the utilitarian design.

In conclusion, the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a dependable and practical cleaning tool that shines in its ability to adapt to different cleaning challenges. Its longevity, dual-sided functionality, and overall durability make it a solid investment for anyone seeking a reliable cleaning companion. While some refinements could enhance its aesthetic appeal, its performance remains the true highlight. Say goodbye to stubborn stains and embrace the convenience of these scrub sponges in your cleaning arsenal.

Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a reliable and effective cleaning solution that effortlessly balances form and function. With a sturdy build and thoughtful design, these sponges prove to be a versatile companion in tackling various cleaning tasks around the house.

The pack's inclusion of six sponges ensures an extended period of use, making it a cost-effective option for those who require a long-lasting cleaning tool. The dual-sided design, featuring a scrubbing side and a softer wiping side, offers the flexibility needed to address both stubborn stains and delicate surfaces. This adaptability proves especially handy in the kitchen, where grime and grease are common adversaries.

One of the standout features of these sponges is their durability. The scrubbing side effectively removes tough residue without wearing down too quickly, while the wiping side maintains its integrity through multiple uses. This robustness translates into fewer replacements and less waste, contributing to a more sustainable cleaning routine.

While the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge pack delivers on its promises, there is room for slight improvement. The scrubbing surface, while effective, may feel abrasive on more delicate items. Additionally, a greater variety of colors or patterns could add a touch of visual appeal to the utilitarian design.

In conclusion, the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a dependable and practical cleaning tool that shines in its ability to adapt to different cleaning challenges. Its longevity, dual-sided functionality, and overall durability make it a solid investment for anyone seeking a reliable cleaning companion. While some refinements could enhance its aesthetic appeal, its performance remains the true highlight. Say goodbye to stubborn stains and embrace the convenience of these scrub sponges in your cleaning arsenal.

Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product to use for once and all. It is for day to day normal use and for normal stain utensils. Thank you.,S.S.
Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),4.0 out of 5 stars,Have always been purchasing the original scotch brite pads since they don't leave behind residue on the plates which we then inevitably digest while eating off plates. Because, let's face it, how much ever we wash the plates, there is always micro-residue from the cheap ripped off scrub pads in the market. The Scotch Brite scrub pads don't degrade like their cheap counterparts and hence last longer.
Price could be cheaper but then this is a premium product with the 3M logo. Gotta pay for the brand and the quality.,su-personic

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this product in May-2024, total 3 nos for my different bathroom showers. After almost 3 months of usage. I'm forced to post this review. So everything was fine till date. Even the filter was doing a good job. The problem comes when u want to replace the cartridge or u want to change the position of the cartridge. So 1st time I changed the direction of cartridge from the filter upside down. This is required to be done as per the company's instruction. It took hell lot of ime to do this job..I don't know why they have made this filter and cartridge assembly in such a bad design that u cannot remove the cartridge from the filter. I did this anyhow and second time I tried this today with another filter but the cartridge is not getting separated whatever I tried. If the manufacturer wanted to sell cartridge as a replacement or consumable item then it should have been user friendly. Even entire cartridge got damaged but it didn't come out. I am had Even purchased extra cartridge for this filter..it's a waste for me now..I don't know any other person faced the same problems but this is the worst design i must say. Again the filter is expensive around 2k..u cannot waste this much money for 3-4 months usage.i would request water science team to see this and help me out,Pranav Kankee

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s been about 4 days since I got this product and I’m happy with it as a baby monitor so far. It was easy to set up. As it can rest on any flat surface, I didn’t need to install it anywhere but it comes with all the necessary accessories for a wall mount. But because of the flat design I can put it anywhere near my baby, and even if I move her to another room, I can take the camera with me. The 360° rotation is impressive and the video quality is great, especially since I use it on the phone mostly—even 480p is sufficient.

The best features are the sound and movement triggers. If my little one wakes up annd moves around and/or cries, notifications are sent to my phone and the feed is also recorded for that portion (in case you want to check what disturbed them). This is great if you need to be in another room—gives you peace of mind. In fact, the sound trigger feature is not available in other cameras in this price range so this was the main deciding factor for my choice. The live feed is definitely a boon to make sure baby is fine when you’re away from her. You can also zoom in on the live feed, which is a cool little feature that I was not expecting. Plus, with the recording feature, you get to have little memories of the baby waking up saved away for the future :)

The only feature I’ve not had a chance to test is night vision but some videos of this camera I saw on YouTube seem to show that this feature is solid in the camera.

Right now I’m on the Imou Life trial subscription because it’s free and will save all recordings to the cloud (up to 3 days). I’ll move to a micro SD soon though. Thinking of also getting a power bank to make it truly portable. Overall, this device is great value and I’d recommend it for parents looking for a baby monitor.

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,3.0 out of 5 stars,The camera is really good. I am using it since 2 years and the performance is still decent. It has decent night vision and quality. It rotates 360° horizontally and 270° vertically. You can use sd card or buy their subscription for storage which I will talk about later. But!!! The most annoying thingಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ!!! Is actually it's software (⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)(⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)!!! I should write this thing in app's review but I think it should be added in product review too as it shows your experience using the product. So the first and major problem is that the app logs out every 3-4 days you don't use it which is very annoying. Imagine there is an emergency at your home and you need to turn on the camera ASAP, you open the app and boom!! Throw your emergency away and login here(⁠◠⁠ω◕⁠)!!
Also trust me, it is veryyy like very complicated and hard to login. The other issue is bro why do you even sell you products in India if you don't want to accept India's payment options. You can't use UPI apps it tells you to use paypal, bro seriously how the hell am I supposed to use paypal here or else use international cards :D!! And don't just use international cards but you have to buy the monthly subscription and trust me again it is very hard to cancel the subscription. I only need the camera twice or thrice a year so why should I waste my money in buying the subscription every month!?!??
Well this is my review it ends here.

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,Image quality: good.
Night vision: very good
Wireless connectivity: good
Detection: very good.
Notification: very good
Feature: All required features are available.
Bad: when to talk, camera sound quality need to improve. Meaning camera sound system need to improve. But sound captured by camre is very good.
Alarm: good,Rajdeep Sen
Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,4.0 out of 5 stars,Updating my review after one month of use. No change in my rating and just updating more prons and cons

Pros
1. Good indoor camera for normal use.
2. Configuring is easy
3.Tapo app is responsive and working good
4. Video Clarity is ok
5. Sound is ok
6. Rotation is smooth , but a very small sound while rotating. A person who is standing near to camera can notice this sound
7. Zooming is ok , but no optical zoom
8. Night vision is good
9. You can add presets and presets are working good. I am specifically telling this because presets won't work well in some other brand cameraz . But for tapo it is working very good.

10. You can adjust rotation angle and it is one of the feature missing in other camera.

11. Person detection is working well and you can easily differtiate normal motion detection with person detection by a person symbol on thumbnails.

Cons
1. Cloud storage is expensive
2. No optical zoom, only digital zoom. I didn't like zoom clarity compared to other 3mp models. If you want to zoom a large distance , don't take this.i own an ezviz 1k camera and i liked zoom clarity of that than this.
3. Can't control the siren as per our will.siren works only in motion detection. So if a small insect is flying , then it will make sound. But we can restrict it to human detection. I always prefer an alarm with a button which we can trigger from app.
4. Play back or recorded video in memory card fast-forward option is not via slider. You can select a speed and it will fast forward based on that. But I always prefer a slider for fast-forward.

5. Tapo is autorotating sometimes. Not sure why . I don't want this feature.
6. One major con I noticed is the wifi network updation . Most of the cameras now a days allow you to change wifi network via app . But for tapo we can't change wifi via app. I can see network selection is ready only field and no action on that.

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was skeptical when this camera was recommended to me. It looked both too easy to be of use, and too complicated to actually set up and use. I couldn't have been more wrong. This TP-Link Tapo security camera is just what I needed. I bought one to try and see, and the minute it was set up and I could see what it could do, Immediately ordered three more. It is an easy setup task, and the benefits of having them are so much more than I would have expected. They are also more affordable than I expected. I now have one in each of my main rooms, and I can see what's happening in my house from the office desk. I have yet to try to access my house through the camera from another country, but I have no doubt that it would work. I use it to make sure my pets are OK. The camera pans, tilts, has night vision, records, has a privacy mode, can be wall mounted or free standing, and I can talk through the camera, which will be a weight off my mind when I have to go abroad and need to see if my pet sitter is actually doing what has been asked of them. If I can feel like this about my pets, I can imagine how a parent might feel to be able to watch their children through them! I recommend these cameras with no hesitation. Just FYI - there is an option to sign up for a monthly payable cloud storage system for these cameras. But if you are not keen to do that, you have to buy a storage card to record what you need. (There is an option to turn on the privacy mode which means the cameras will only record if the privacy mode is switched off.)

We were out of town for few days and this camera is suppose to monitor the house, but unfortunately it worked for only two days. WiFi was working fine other cameras from Philips was doing their job. But this Tapo camera went offline and did nothing for rest of the time. I have enabled the auto restart setting on daily intervals, but I believe that didn’t work. Tried to reach out customer care, but they will not respond, and since the product is working fine and issue is intermittent, was not able to show to the customer care. Think before you buy. Go with Philips cameras as they support offline recordings, though they are bit costly.,shreyas

Avec sa résolution 2K, la qualité d’image est impressionnante, offrant des vidéos nettes et claires, ce qui permet de capturer les moindres détails, même dans des conditions de faible luminosité. L’angle de vision de 360° et la possibilité de faire pivoter la caméra à distance via l’application Tapo ajoutent une flexibilité appréciable, permettant de couvrir une large zone avec un seul appareil.

L’installation est simple et rapide, même pour les moins technophiles. L’application Tapo est intuitive, rendant le contrôle de la caméra et l’accès aux vidéos enregistrées très faciles. De plus, la fonctionnalité de détection de mouvement et les notifications en temps réel sont très utiles pour rester informé de ce qui se passe chez soi.

Cependant, il y a quelques points à améliorer. Par exemple, la caméra nécessite une connexion Wi-Fi stable pour fonctionner de manière optimale, ce qui peut être un problème si le signal est faible. De plus, bien que la caméra soit livrée avec un emplacement pour carte microSD, le stockage en ligne est payant, ce qui peut représenter un coût supplémentaire à long terme.

En dépit de ces petits inconvénients, la Tapo 2K C210 reste un excellent rapport qualité-prix et je la recommande sans hésitation pour sécuriser votre domicile.

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,4.0 out of 5 stars,Updating my review after one month of use. No change in my rating and just updating more prons and cons

Pros
1. Good indoor camera for normal use.
2. Configuring is easy
3.Tapo app is responsive and working good
4. Video Clarity is ok
5. Sound is ok
6. Rotation is smooth , but a very small sound while rotating. A person who is standing near to camera can notice this sound
7. Zooming is ok , but no optical zoom
8. Night vision is good
9. You can add presets and presets are working good. I am specifically telling this because presets won't work well in some other brand cameraz . But for tapo it is working very good.

10. You can adjust rotation angle and it is one of the feature missing in other camera.

11. Person detection is working well and you can easily differtiate normal motion detection with person detection by a person symbol on thumbnails.

Cons
1. Cloud storage is expensive
2. No optical zoom, only digital zoom. I didn't like zoom clarity compared to other 3mp models. If you want to zoom a large distance , don't take this.i own an ezviz 1k camera and i liked zoom clarity of that than this.
3. Can't control the siren as per our will.siren works only in motion detection. So if a small insect is flying , then it will make sound. But we can restrict it to human detection. I always prefer an alarm with a button which we can trigger from app.
4. Play back or recorded video in memory card fast-forward option is not via slider. You can select a speed and it will fast forward based on that. But I always prefer a slider for fast-forward.

5. Tapo is autorotating sometimes. Not sure why . I don't want this feature.
6. One major con I noticed is the wifi network updation . Most of the cameras now a days allow you to change wifi network via app . But for tapo we can't change wifi via app. I can see network selection is ready only field and no action on that.

It looked both too easy to be of use, and too complicated to actually set up and use. I couldn't have been more wrong. This TP-Link Tapo security camera is just what I needed. I bought one to try and see, and the minute it was set up and I could see what it could do, Immediately ordered three more. It is an easy setup task, and the benefits of having them are so much more than I would have expected. They are also more affordable than I expected. I now have one in each of my main rooms, and I can see what's happening in my house from the office desk. I have yet to try to access my house through the camera from another country, but I have no doubt that it would work. I use it to make sure my pets are OK. The camera pans, tilts, has night vision, records, has a privacy mode, can be wall mounted or free standing, and I can talk through the camera, which will be a weight off my mind when I have to go abroad and need to see if my pet sitter is actually doing what has been asked of them. If I can feel like this about my pets, I can imagine how a parent might feel to be able to watch their children through them! I recommend these cameras with no hesitation. Just FYI - there is an option to sign up for a monthly payable cloud storage system for these cameras. But if you are not keen to do that, you have to buy a storage card to record what you need. (There is an option to turn on the privacy mode which means the cameras will only record if the privacy mode is switched off.)

Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL (Modular,1 Piece),5.0 out of 5 stars,Firstly, the modular design of this broom is very convenient. It comes in 1 piece, making it easy to assemble and use. The handle is also adjustable, which is perfect for someone like me who is on the shorter side. I can adjust the handle to my desired length for comfortable sweeping. One of the main features that drew me to this broom was the promise of no dust. I have always struggled with traditional brooms leaving behind a trail of dust and debris. However, the Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL lives up to its name. The bristles are made of soft, fine fibers that effectively pick up all the dust and dirt without scattering it around. This has made sweeping a much cleaner and less messy task. Another great feature of this broom is its XL size. The broom head is wider than most traditional brooms, which means I can cover more surface area with each sweep. This has significantly reduced my cleaning time. The broom is also lightweight, making it easy to maneuver around furniture and corners. The quality of this broom is top-notch. The bristles are strong and durable, and they have not shown any signs of wear and tear even after multiple uses. The handle is also sturdy and feels comfortable to hold.,One Malabar Hill

Like if there is no internet connection it won't work, won't even record locally on the sd card. Why? This could be fixed via a software update but even on my previous mi camera, it hasn't been fixed for over 2 years now.
Also the Surveillance section in the app shows "No videos yet" even though there are videos. The video player just doesn't play them. I have an older mi 2i camera in the same app where this feature works perfectly.,Vijender Singh

Scotch-Brite Plastic Spin Mop Head and Handle (Suitable for Scotch-Brite 2 in 1 Spin Mop Only),3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this mop from Scotch Brite because I was frustrated with the Prestige ones, many of which now seem to be fake copies. Although this one is a bit pricey, it’s been working well after several months of use.

Pros:
1) The spin mechanism is effective; it dries quickly after just two spins.
2) The mopping material is decent and gets the job done, although it mops in patches due to the design.
3) It’s very easy to assemble.
4) You can buy just the mop stick alone if you already have a mop tub.

Cons:
1) The mop’s thread material is quite delicate. After the first wash, at least three strands came out, and a few more falls off with each use. And will continue for sure, I know.

Overall, I’m still using it. It’s average but functional for daily use.

Ozone Safe Locker for Home | Digital Lock | Safety Locker For Home | Non Motorized | Master & User PIN Code Access | Tijori Locker | Black | 16 Litres | 24 Months Warranty By Ozone (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,The secure locker arrived packaged in the branded box, cushioned on both sides with safety pads. However, the box lacked a proper seal, featuring only a simple cello tape adorned with the brand name. Setting up the safe proved to be straightforward, thanks to the provided instructions. It would have been beneficial if the instructions also covered setting the date and time, but I managed to navigate it by referring to their instructional YouTube video.

Upon opening the safe, I noticed it was disappointingly dirty. It's essential for the dispatch team to ensure cleanliness by removing paint, dust, and other debris before shipping the product. The carpet in the lower slot, while present, is inadequately glued and doesn't fit properly. Furthermore, the carpet piece's size does not match the dimensions, resulting in unsightly folds. The key is flimsy and seems generic, I am worried that any one with similar key can open the locker which totally defies the purpose of having the locker at first place.

The outer body of the safe is robust and well-constructed, seemingly made in India. However, my concern lies with the locking mechanism, which is made in China and appears flimsy. Only time will reveal the true durability of the safe. Additionally, the product seems slightly overpriced compared to competitors such as Amazon Basics safe lockers.

Despite these drawbacks, I recommend the product based on its overall performance and construction.

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this bottle cleaner. This is the second one I have ordered. I have kept one each at my home and my in law's place. It does the job. It does reach the bottom corners of the bottles as claimed. Overall a good one. I use it mostly for the kids bottles. It has a good reach. It dries quickly once you shake off as much water as you can.
The sponge is detachable from the handle as mentioned in the product description, to enable it to be changed once the sponge weras out. Now I haven't checked if the sponge head is available separately. Otherwise this is a bit expensive.,Mom to an autistic kid.
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,The scrubber given is very good and it cleans the milk residue properly , the only issue is that the handle detaches and the scrubber stays the bottle which is very hard to remove,Udayani
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),3.0 out of 5 stars,Suitable for bottles with slightly bigger mouths; though not meant for heavy use, if head gets stuck inside any bottle, its sponge part can come off the handle!,Ajay
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely wonderful product. Exactly what i needed. Perfect cleaning.

Another review mentioned, the scrub coming off if bottle mouth is small... it is a hassle but not a hig one. Having a removable facility ensures that the scrub can be cleaned throughly. So, it is good feature.,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),1.0 out of 5 stars,3rd class quality. Unable to clean the bottles easily. Foam and handle got seperated during cleaning making the cleaning uncomfortable and ineffective. Worst brush,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this bottle cleaner for cleaning steel water bottle. I was facing issue with local brushes where the sponge on the lower part of the brush would get off quickly creating issues in cleaning the bottom of the bottle from inside. Did purchase this product with the hopes that it would solve this issue and the product delivered true to my expectations.

The only downside I see is that if the mouth of the bottle is a bit smaller, there can be issues in getting the brush outside without the risk of cleaning brush stuck inside the bottle.,Shantanu
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,Getting the perfect bottle cleaning brush is a hard task for Mommies. This one does the job well but as the scrubber is loosely attached to the handle..it often comes out while pulling away from smaller bottles.

I suggest Team Scotch Brite to make a smaller one of this for kids feeding bottles.,Aprajita Mishra

I have kept one each at my home and my in law's place. It does the job. It does reach the bottom corners of the bottles as claimed. Overall a good one. I use it mostly for the kids bottles. It has a good reach. It dries quickly once you shake off as much water as you can.
The sponge is detachable from the handle as mentioned in the product description, to enable it to be changed once the sponge weras out. Now I haven't checked if the sponge head is available separately. Otherwise this is a bit expensive.,Mom to an autistic kid.
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,The scrubber given is very good and it cleans the milk residue properly , the only issue is that the handle detaches and the scrubber stays the bottle which is very hard to remove,Udayani
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),3.0 out of 5 stars,Suitable for bottles with slightly bigger mouths; though not meant for heavy use, if head gets stuck inside any bottle, its sponge part can come off the handle!,Ajay
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely wonderful product. Exactly what i needed. Perfect cleaning.

Another review mentioned, the scrub coming off if bottle mouth is small... it is a hassle but not a hig one. Having a removable facility ensures that the scrub can be cleaned throughly. So, it is good feature.,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),1.0 out of 5 stars,3rd class quality. Unable to clean the bottles easily. Foam and handle got seperated during cleaning making the cleaning uncomfortable and ineffective. Worst brush,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this bottle cleaner for cleaning steel water bottle. I was facing issue with local brushes where the sponge on the lower part of the brush would get off quickly creating issues in cleaning the bottom of the bottle from inside. Did purchase this product with the hopes that it would solve this issue and the product delivered true to my expectations.

The only downside I see is that if the mouth of the bottle is a bit smaller, there can be issues in getting the brush outside without the risk of cleaning brush stuck inside the bottle.,Shantanu
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,Getting the perfect bottle cleaning brush is a hard task for Mommies. This one does the job well but as the scrubber is loosely attached to the handle..it often comes out while pulling away from smaller bottles.

I suggest Team Scotch Brite to make a smaller one of this for kids feeding bottles.,Aprajita Mishra
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Giving review after using it for a year..very good quality..still going.must buy,Akash Singh
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure how long this will last but it is stronger than the usual "bottle brush" as it is made from foam rasher than "brush material"

Works well - just a pity I had to buy two!!!,Peter D. G. Raven

The video quality is too good and the setup is very easy. But the product needs lot of improvements which I am listing out below.
1. The tilt option is not that great and you can't focus the floor and door at the same time if it is installed above 5 feet high.
2. The 2 way talk option is just for name sake. The speaker quality is one of the worst one could imagine. You literally need to keep your ears in the camera to hear what the other one speaks.
3. Sound notifications and motion notifications are annoying which made me to disable them. Sound of crows and dogs far from home are detected (which happens all the time) and sends notifications. Similarly screen movements are sent as motion detection notifications. Detection of Human voice and motion alone could have been helpful and solved the real need.
4. Onvif never works. It asks for Password reset but if I select that nothing happens but freezing.
5. Smart controls seems not working. I have scheduled things for eg. Switch on the recording when it is 8am. But it never started to record.
6. Also there is no option to automate recording like Stop recording from Night 8 to Morning 8 every day.
7. Option to view in PC is too naive. If I wanted to view the feeds from office (or other phone restricted place), I can't do that as I need to scan the QR shown by the webpage through the mobile app. Even then it hardly works/opens.

6. Also there is no option to automate recording like Stop recording from Night 8 to Morning 8 every day.
7. Option to view in PC is too naive. If I wanted to view the feeds from office (or other phone restricted place), I can't do that as I need to scan the QR shown by the webpage through the mobile app. Even then it hardly works/opens.

Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reasonable pricing and of the correct size for cleaning purposes. Easy to use and very practical.,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a reliable and effective cleaning solution that effortlessly balances form and function. With a sturdy build and thoughtful design, these sponges prove to be a versatile companion in tackling various cleaning tasks around the house.

The pack's inclusion of six sponges ensures an extended period of use, making it a cost-effective option for those who require a long-lasting cleaning tool. The dual-sided design, featuring a scrubbing side and a softer wiping side, offers the flexibility needed to address both stubborn stains and delicate surfaces. This adaptability proves especially handy in the kitchen, where grime and grease are common adversaries.

One of the standout features of these sponges is their durability. The scrubbing side effectively removes tough residue without wearing down too quickly, while the wiping side maintains its integrity through multiple uses. This robustness translates into fewer replacements and less waste, contributing to a more sustainable cleaning routine.

While the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge pack delivers on its promises, there is room for slight improvement. The scrubbing surface, while effective, may feel abrasive on more delicate items. Additionally, a greater variety of colors or patterns could add a touch of visual appeal to the utilitarian design.

In conclusion, the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a dependable and practical cleaning tool that shines in its ability to adapt to different cleaning challenges. Its longevity, dual-sided functionality, and overall durability make it a solid investment for anyone seeking a reliable cleaning companion. While some refinements could enhance its aesthetic appeal, its performance remains the true highlight.

Scotch-Brite Scrub 5 Pad (Green),4.0 out of 5 stars,Have always been purchasing the original scotch brite pads since they don't leave behind residue on the plates which we then inevitably digest while eating off plates. Because, let's face it, how much ever we wash the plates, there is always micro-residue from the cheap ripped off scrub pads in the market. The Scotch Brite scrub pads don't degrade like their cheap counterparts and hence last longer.

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this product in May-2024, total 3 nos for my different bathroom showers. After almost 3 months of usage. I'm forced to post this review. So everything was fine till date. Even the filter was doing a good job. The problem comes when u want to replace the cartridge or u want to change the position of the cartridge. So 1st time I changed the direction of cartridge from the filter upside down. This is required to be done as per the company's instruction. It took hell lot of ime to do this job..I don't know why they have made this filter and cartridge assembly in such a bad design that u cannot remove the cartridge from the filter. I did this anyhow and second time I tried this today with another filter but the cartridge is not getting separated whatever I tried. If the manufacturer wanted to sell cartridge as a replacement or consumable item then it should have been user friendly. Even entire cartridge got damaged but it didn't come out. I am had Even purchased extra cartridge for this filter..it's a waste for me now..I don't know any other person faced the same problems but this is the worst design i must say. Again the filter is expensive around 2k..u cannot waste this much money for 3-4 months usage.i would request water science team to see this and help me out,Pranav Kankee

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had ordered 2 filters inspite of many bad reviews. One filter is working fine but second has water leaking from the body. Installation is easy but the key tool provided is useless to say the least.
Edit: the filter which was working fine was not used for 15 days and now it has choked. Water is not passing through it. Such useless products seems they are more reliant on paid reviews otherwise there is no explanation to generally good reviews when both the products i recieved were faulty,av123456

WaterScience CLEO Shower and Tap Filter for Hard Water | Water Softener for Bathroom | Hard Water Filter - CLEO-SFU-423,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this product in May-2024, total 3 nos for my different bathroom showers. After almost 3 months of usage. I'm forced to post this review. So everything was fine till date. Even the filter was doing a good job. The problem comes when u want to replace the cartridge or u want to change the position of the cartridge. So 1st time I changed the direction of cartridge from the filter upside down. This is required to be done as per the company's instruction. It took hell lot of ime to do this job..I don't know why they have made this filter and cartridge assembly in such a bad design that u cannot remove the cartridge from the filter. I did this anyhow and second time I tried this today with another filter but the cartridge is not getting separated whatever I tried. If the manufacturer wanted to sell cartridge as a replacement or consumable item then it should have been user friendly. Even entire cartridge got damaged but it didn't come out. I am had Even purchased extra cartridge for this filter..it's a waste for me now..I don't know any other person faced the same problems but this is the worst design i must say. Again the filter is expensive around 2k..u cannot waste this much money for 3-4 months usage.i would request water science team to see this and help me out,Pranav Kankee

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s been about 4 days since I got this product and I’m happy with it as a baby monitor so far. It was easy to set up. As it can rest on any flat surface, I didn’t need to install it anywhere but it comes with all the necessary accessories for a wall mount. But because of the flat design I can put it anywhere near my baby, and even if I move her to another room, I can take the camera with me. The 360° rotation is impressive and the video quality is great, especially since I use it on the phone mostly—even 480p is sufficient.

The best features are the sound and movement triggers. If my little one wakes up annd moves around and/or cries, notifications are sent to my phone and the feed is also recorded for that portion (in case you want to check what disturbed them). This is great if you need to be in another room—gives you peace of mind. In fact, the sound trigger feature is not available in other cameras in this price range so this was the main deciding factor for my choice. The live feed is definitely a boon to make sure baby is fine when you’re away from her. You can also zoom in on the live feed, which is a cool little feature that I was not expecting. Plus, with the recording feature, you get to have little memories of the baby waking up saved away for the future :)

The only feature I’ve not had a chance to test is night vision but some videos of this camera I saw on YouTube seem to show that this feature is solid in the camera.

Right now I’m on the Imou Life trial subscription because it’s free and will save all recordings to the cloud (up to 3 days). I’ll move to a micro SD soon though. Thinking of also getting a power bank to make it truly portable. Overall, this device is great value and I’d recommend it for parents looking for a baby monitor.

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,3.0 out of 5 stars,The camera is really good. I am using it since 2 years and the performance is still decent. It has decent night vision and quality. It rotates 360° horizontally and 270° vertically. You can use sd card or buy their subscription for storage which I will talk about later. But!!! The most annoying thingಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ!!! Is actually it's software (⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)(⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)!!! I should write this thing in app's review but I think it should be added in product review too as it shows your experience using the product. So the first and major problem is that the app logs out every 3-4 days you don't use it which is very annoying. Imagine there is an emergency at your home and you need to turn on the camera ASAP, you open the app and boom!! Throw your emergency away and login here(⁠◠⁠ω◕⁠)!!
Also trust me, it is veryyy like very complicated and hard to login. The other issue is bro why do you even sell you products in India if you don't want to accept India's payment options. You can't use UPI apps it tells you to use paypal, bro seriously how the hell am I supposed to use paypal here or else use international cards :D!! And don't just use international cards but you have to buy the monthly subscription and trust me again it is very hard to cancel the subscription. I only need the camera twice or thrice a year so why should I waste my money in buying the subscription every month!?!??
Well this is my review it ends here.

IMOU 360° 1080P Full HD CCTV Security Camera, Human Detection, Motion Tracking, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision, Dome Camera with WiFi & Ethernet Connection, Alexa Enabled, Up to 256GB SD Card Support,3.0 out of 5 stars,The camera is really good. I am using it since 2 years and the performance is still decent. It has decent night vision and quality. It rotates 360° horizontally and 270° vertically. You can use sd card or buy their subscription for storage which I will talk about later. But!!! The most annoying thingಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ!!! Is actually it's software (⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)(⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)!!! I should write this thing in app's review but I think it should be added in product review too as it shows your experience using the product. So the first and major problem is that the app logs out every 3-4 days you don't use it which is very annoying. Imagine there is an emergency at your home and you need to turn on the camera ASAP, you open the app and boom!! Throw your emergency away and login here(⁠◠⁠ω◕⁠)!!
Also trust me, it is veryyy like very complicated and hard to login. The other issue is bro why do you even sell you products in India if you don't want to accept India's payment options. You can't use UPI apps it tells you to use paypal, bro seriously how the hell am I supposed to use paypal here or else use international cards :D!! And don't just use international cards but you have to buy the monthly subscription and trust me again it is very hard to cancel the subscription. I only need the camera twice or thrice a year so why should I waste my money in buying the subscription every month!?!??
Well this is my review it ends here.

In first order the product had defect but when I contacted it's customer support they reverted immediately and was replaced in 2 days with new one. So they after service is also very good. Just one thing I am facing problem is SIREN is not playing properly it's getting stop in 2-3 seconds instead of 30 seconds. But overall product is fabulous in the price that is offered. Just go for it.,Amazon Customer

Night vision: very good

Feature: All required features are available.
Bad: when to talk, camera sound quality need to improve. Meaning camera sound system need to improve. But sound captured by camre is very good.

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,4.0 out of 5 stars,Updating my review after one month of use. No change in my rating and just updating more prons and cons

Pros
1. Good indoor camera for normal use.
2. Configuring is easy
3.Tapo app is responsive and working good
4. Video Clarity is ok
5. Sound is ok
6. Rotation is smooth , but a very small sound while rotating. A person who is standing near to camera can notice this sound
7. Zooming is ok , but no optical zoom
8. Night vision is good
9. You can add presets and presets are working good. I am specifically telling this because presets won't work well in some other brand cameraz . But for tapo it is working very good.

10. You can adjust rotation angle and it is one of the feature missing in other camera.

11. Person detection is working well and you can easily differtiate normal motion detection with person detection by a person symbol on thumbnails.

Cons
1. Cloud storage is expensive
2. No optical zoom, only digital zoom. I didn't like zoom clarity compared to other 3mp models. If you want to zoom a large distance , don't take this.i own an ezviz 1k camera and i liked zoom clarity of that than this.
3. Can't control the siren as per our will.siren works only in motion detection. So if a small insect is flying , then it will make sound. But we can restrict it to human detection. I always prefer an alarm with a button which we can trigger from app.
4. Play back or recorded video in memory card fast-forward option is not via slider. You can select a speed and it will fast forward based on that. But I always prefer a slider for fast-forward.

5. Tapo is autorotating sometimes. Not sure why . I don't want this feature.
6. One major con I noticed is the wifi network updation . Most of the cameras now a days allow you to change wifi network via app . But for tapo we can't change wifi via app. I can see network selection is ready only field and no action on that.

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was skeptical when this camera was recommended to me. It looked both too easy to be of use, and too complicated to actually set up and use. I couldn't have been more wrong. This TP-Link Tapo security camera is just what I needed. I bought one to try and see, and the minute it was set up and I could see what it could do, Immediately ordered three more. It is an easy setup task, and the benefits of having them are so much more than I would have expected. They are also more affordable than I expected. I now have one in each of my main rooms, and I can see what's happening in my house from the office desk. I have yet to try to access my house through the camera from another country, but I have no doubt that it would work. I use it to make sure my pets are OK. The camera pans, tilts, has night vision, records, has a privacy mode, can be wall mounted or free standing, and I can talk through the camera, which will be a weight off my mind when I have to go abroad and need to see if my pet sitter is actually doing what has been asked of them. If I can feel like this about my pets, I can imagine how a parent might feel to be able to watch their children through them! I recommend these cameras with no hesitation. Just FYI - there is an option to sign up for a monthly payable cloud storage system for these cameras. But if you are not keen to do that, you have to buy a storage card to record what you need. (There is an option to turn on the privacy mode which means the cameras will only record if the privacy mode is switched off.)

We were out of town for few days and this camera is suppose to monitor the house, but unfortunately it worked for only two days. WiFi was working fine other cameras from Philips was doing their job. But this Tapo camera went offline and did nothing for rest of the time. I have enabled the auto restart setting on daily intervals, but I believe that didn’t work. Tried to reach out customer care, but they will not respond, and since the product is working fine and issue is intermittent, was not able to show to the customer care. Think before you buy. Go with Philips cameras as they support offline recordings, though they are bit costly.,shreyas

Tapo TP-Link C210 360° 3MP Full HD 2304 X 1296P Video Pan/Tilt Smart Wi-Fi Security Camera | Alexa Enabled | 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection | Indoor CCTV White,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cette caméra est un excellent choix pour ceux qui recherchent une solution de surveillance domestique efficace et abordable. Avec sa résolution 2K, la qualité d’image est impressionnante, offrant des vidéos nettes et claires, ce qui permet de capturer les moindres détails, même dans des conditions de faible luminosité. L’angle de vision de 360° et la possibilité de faire pivoter la caméra à distance via l’application Tapo ajoutent une flexibilité appréciable, permettant de couvrir une large zone avec un seul appareil.

L’installation est simple et rapide, même pour les moins technophiles. L’application Tapo est intuitive, rendant le contrôle de la caméra et l’accès aux vidéos enregistrées très faciles. De plus, la fonctionnalité de détection de mouvement et les notifications en temps réel sont très utiles pour rester informé de ce qui se passe chez soi.

Cependant, il y a quelques points à améliorer. Par exemple, la caméra nécessite une connexion Wi-Fi stable pour fonctionner de manière optimale, ce qui peut être un problème si le signal est faible. De plus, bien que la caméra soit livrée avec un emplacement pour carte microSD, le stockage en ligne est payant, ce qui peut représenter un coût supplémentaire à long terme.

En dépit de ces petits inconvénients, la Tapo 2K C210 reste un excellent rapport qualité-prix et je la recommande sans hésitation pour sécuriser votre domicile.

Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),5.0 out of 5 stars,Very handy,easy to clean and remove hardness and stains from the bath room floor,even I use it on the bathroom walls too.highly recommendable product,Aafiya
Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),4.0 out of 5 stars,Size mentioned under Highlights is not correct.,Tarun
Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),3.0 out of 5 stars,The base is not stable by design. It swivels uncontrollably, and will fold over while scrubbing. So it is not possible to scrub without interruptions.

The materials are somewhat sturdy and won't break.

So 3 stars for that. 2 stars less for usability.,ReviewerX
Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),5.0 out of 5 stars,It is very good to clean the tiled wall of bathroom/toilet. limited utility but excellent for the mentioned purpose.,Dhiman S.
Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),1.0 out of 5 stars,This product could have been so much more. It has the brush, it has the stand, and it has the mobility. However, because you cannot keep it in a static position, it simply pivots whenever pressure it applied. Because of this "feature," you cannot clean anything with sufficient amounts of force.

The idea is good. But the execution is lacking. Avoid!,Sunny

Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),3.0 out of 5 stars,The base is not stable by design. It swivels uncontrollably, and will fold over while scrubbing. So it is not possible to scrub without interruptions.

The materials are somewhat sturdy and won't break.

So 3 stars for that. 2 stars less for usability.,ReviewerX
Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),5.0 out of 5 stars,It is very good to clean the tiled wall of bathroom/toilet. limited utility but excellent for the mentioned purpose.,Dhiman S.
Gala - 151810 Scrubber with Long Handle (Multicolour),1.0 out of 5 stars,This product could have been so much more. It has the brush, it has the stand, and it has the mobility. However, because you cannot keep it in a static position, it simply pivots whenever pressure it applied. Because of this "feature," you cannot clean anything with sufficient amounts of force.

The idea is good. But the execution is lacking. Avoid!,Sunny

Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL (Modular,1 Piece),5.0 out of 5 stars,Firstly, the modular design of this broom is very convenient. It comes in 1 piece, making it easy to assemble and use. The handle is also adjustable, which is perfect for someone like me who is on the shorter side. I can adjust the handle to my desired length for comfortable sweeping. One of the main features that drew me to this broom was the promise of no dust. I have always struggled with traditional brooms leaving behind a trail of dust and debris. However, the Gala No Dust Floor Broom XL lives up to its name. The bristles are made of soft, fine fibers that effectively pick up all the dust and dirt without scattering it around. This has made sweeping a much cleaner and less messy task. Another great feature of this broom is its XL size. The broom head is wider than most traditional brooms, which means I can cover more surface area with each sweep. This has significantly reduced my cleaning time. The broom is also lightweight, making it easy to maneuver around furniture and corners. The quality of this broom is top-notch. The bristles are strong and durable, and they have not shown any signs of wear and tear even after multiple uses. The handle is also sturdy and feels comfortable to hold.,One Malabar Hill

Scotch-Brite Plastic Spin Mop Head and Handle (Suitable for Scotch-Brite 2 in 1 Spin Mop Only),3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this mop from Scotch Brite because I was frustrated with the Prestige ones, many of which now seem to be fake copies. Although this one is a bit pricey, it’s been working well after several months of use.

Pros:
1) The spin mechanism is effective; it dries quickly after just two spins.
2) The mopping material is decent and gets the job done, although it mops in patches due to the design.
3) It’s very easy to assemble.
4) You can buy just the mop stick alone if you already have a mop tub.

Cons:
1) The mop’s thread material is quite delicate. After the first wash, at least three strands came out, and a few more falls off with each use. And will continue for sure, I know.

Overall, I’m still using it. It’s average but functional for daily use.

Ozone Safe Locker for Home | Digital Lock | Safety Locker For Home | Non Motorized | Master & User PIN Code Access | Tijori Locker | Black | 16 Litres | 24 Months Warranty By Ozone (Black),1.0 out of 5 stars,It was a total waste of money. When the locker arrived the keys were missing after contacting the Amazon customer care & ozone customer care they kept redirecting me to one another. Also the installation was cancelled.

Ozone Safe Locker for Home | Digital Lock | Safety Locker For Home | Non Motorized | Master & User PIN Code Access | Tijori Locker | Black | 16 Litres | 24 Months Warranty By Ozone (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,The secure locker arrived packaged in the branded box, cushioned on both sides with safety pads. However, the box lacked a proper seal, featuring only a simple cello tape adorned with the brand name. Setting up the safe proved to be straightforward, thanks to the provided instructions. It would have been beneficial if the instructions also covered setting the date and time, but I managed to navigate it by referring to their instructional YouTube video.

Upon opening the safe, I noticed it was disappointingly dirty. It's essential for the dispatch team to ensure cleanliness by removing paint, dust, and other debris before shipping the product. The carpet in the lower slot, while present, is inadequately glued and doesn't fit properly. Furthermore, the carpet piece's size does not match the dimensions, resulting in unsightly folds. The key is flimsy and seems generic, I am worried that any one with similar key can open the locker which totally defies the purpose of having the locker at first place.

The outer body of the safe is robust and well-constructed, seemingly made in India. However, my concern lies with the locking mechanism, which is made in China and appears flimsy. Only time will reveal the true durability of the safe. Additionally, the product seems slightly overpriced compared to competitors such as Amazon Basics safe lockers.

Despite these drawbacks, I recommend the product based on its overall performance and construction.

Ozone Safe Locker for Home | Digital Lock | Safety Locker For Home | Non Motorized | Master & User PIN Code Access | Tijori Locker | Black | 16 Litres | 24 Months Warranty By Ozone (Black),1.0 out of 5 stars,It was a total waste of money. When the locker arrived the keys were missing after contacting the Amazon customer care & ozone customer care they kept redirecting me to one another. Also the installation was cancelled. I’m still waiting for them to help with the issue. They just seem to care about it.,Received a cracked Tv 📺 horrible service. After sending several emails and complaints no response from the team.Unbelievable
Ozone Safe Locker for Home | Digital Lock | Safety Locker For Home | Non Motorized | Master & User PIN Code Access | Tijori Locker | Black | 16 Litres | 24 Months Warranty By Ozone (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,The product is good and services and responses to query was excellent excellent.

Ozone Safe Locker for Home | Digital Lock | Safety Locker For Home | Non Motorized | Master & User PIN Code Access | Tijori Locker | Black | 16 Litres | 24 Months Warranty By Ozone (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,The secure locker arrived packaged in the branded box, cushioned on both sides with safety pads. However, the box lacked a proper seal, featuring only a simple cello tape adorned with the brand name. Setting up the safe proved to be straightforward, thanks to the provided instructions. It would have been beneficial if the instructions also covered setting the date and time, but I managed to navigate it by referring to their instructional YouTube video.

Upon opening the safe, I noticed it was disappointingly dirty. It's essential for the dispatch team to ensure cleanliness by removing paint, dust, and other debris before shipping the product. The carpet in the lower slot, while present, is inadequately glued and doesn't fit properly. Furthermore, the carpet piece's size does not match the dimensions, resulting in unsightly folds. The key is flimsy and seems generic, I am worried that any one with similar key can open the locker which totally defies the purpose of having the locker at first place.

The outer body of the safe is robust and well-constructed, seemingly made in India. However, my concern lies with the locking mechanism, which is made in China and appears flimsy. Only time will reveal the true durability of the safe. Additionally, the product seems slightly overpriced compared to competitors such as Amazon Basics safe lockers.

Despite these drawbacks, I recommend the product based on its overall performance and construction.

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this bottle cleaner. This is the second one I have ordered. I have kept one each at my home and my in law's place. It does the job. It does reach the bottom corners of the bottles as claimed. Overall a good one. I use it mostly for the kids bottles. It has a good reach. It dries quickly once you shake off as much water as you can.
The sponge is detachable from the handle as mentioned in the product description, to enable it to be changed once the sponge weras out. Now I haven't checked if the sponge head is available separately. Otherwise this is a bit expensive.,Mom to an autistic kid.
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,The scrubber given is very good and it cleans the milk residue properly , the only issue is that the handle detaches and the scrubber stays the bottle which is very hard to remove,Udayani

Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this bottle cleaner for cleaning steel water bottle. I was facing issue with local brushes where the sponge on the lower part of the brush would get off quickly creating issues in cleaning the bottom of the bottle from inside. Did purchase this product with the hopes that it would solve this issue and the product delivered true to my expectations.

The only downside I see is that if the mouth of the bottle is a bit smaller, there can be issues in getting the brush outside without the risk of cleaning brush stuck inside the bottle.,Shantanu
Scotch-Brite Plastic Bottle Cleaner Brush (Pink and White,Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,Getting the perfect bottle cleaning brush is a hard task for Mommies.

CP PLUS 3 MP Full HD Smart Wi-fi CCTV Camera | 360° Pan & Tilt | View & Talk | Motion Alert | Night Vision | SD Card (Up to 128 GB) | Alexa & OK Google | 2-Way Talk | IR Distance 10Mtr | CP-E35A,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have bought 2 of them for my home to monitor my kids. The video quality is too good and the setup is very easy. But the product needs lot of improvements which I am listing out below.
1. The tilt option is not that great and you can't focus the floor and door at the same time if it is installed above 5 feet high.
2. The 2 way talk option is just for name sake. The speaker quality is one of the worst one could imagine. You literally need to keep your ears in the camera to hear what the other one speaks.
3. Sound notifications and motion notifications are annoying which made me to disable them. Sound of crows and dogs far from home are detected (which happens all the time) and sends notifications. Similarly screen movements are sent as motion detection notifications. Detection of Human voice and motion alone could have been helpful and solved the real need.
4. Onvif never works. It asks for Password reset but if I select that nothing happens but freezing.
5. Smart controls seems not working. I have scheduled things for eg. Switch on the recording when it is 8am. But it never started to record.
6. Also there is no option to automate recording like Stop recording from Night 8 to Morning 8 every day.
7. Option to view in PC is too naive. If I wanted to view the feeds from office (or other phone restricted place), I can't do that as I need to scan the QR shown by the webpage through the mobile app. Even then it hardly works/opens.

Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reasonable pricing and of the correct size for cleaning purposes. Easy to use and very practical.,Amazon Customer
Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge for Utensil Cleaning (Kitchen scrubber with sponge)- Pack 6,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a reliable and effective cleaning solution that effortlessly balances form and function. With a sturdy build and thoughtful design, these sponges prove to be a versatile companion in tackling various cleaning tasks around the house.

The pack's inclusion of six sponges ensures an extended period of use, making it a cost-effective option for those who require a long-lasting cleaning tool. The dual-sided design, featuring a scrubbing side and a softer wiping side, offers the flexibility needed to address both stubborn stains and delicate surfaces. This adaptability proves especially handy in the kitchen, where grime and grease are common adversaries.

One of the standout features of these sponges is their durability. The scrubbing side effectively removes tough residue without wearing down too quickly, while the wiping side maintains its integrity through multiple uses. This robustness translates into fewer replacements and less waste, contributing to a more sustainable cleaning routine.

While the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge pack delivers on its promises, there is room for slight improvement. The scrubbing surface, while effective, may feel abrasive on more delicate items. Additionally, a greater variety of colors or patterns could add a touch of visual appeal to the utilitarian design.

In conclusion, the Scotch Brite Scrub Sponge Pack of 6 is a dependable and practical cleaning tool that shines in its ability to adapt to different cleaning challenges. Its longevity, dual-sided functionality, and overall durability make it a solid investment for anyone seeking a reliable cleaning companion. While some refinements could enhance its aesthetic appeal, its performance remains the true highlight. Say goodbye to stubborn stains and embrace the convenience of these scrub sponges in your cleaning arsenal.
