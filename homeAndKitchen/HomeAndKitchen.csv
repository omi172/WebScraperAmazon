Panasonic 23 L Convection Microwave Oven(NN-CT353BFDG,Black Mirror, 360° Heat Wrap, Magic Grill),4.0 out of 5 stars,Recently we had to replace our Sharp Microwave oven that had given us stellar service for over 15 years. After a detailed comparison of products from multiple manufacturers, we decided to opt for the Panasonic 23L Convection Microwave Oven (model number NN-CT353BFDG). The reason we chose this against the others were the following:

1. We wanted a full function microwave around 21L in size. The functions we needed include grilling, reheating, defrosting, cooking, etc.
2. We wanted a microwave that was able to distribute the heat across the food kept inside.
3. Of course, we wanted one that is priced reasonably.

As I said before, after extensive research, we ordered for the Panasonic. It arrived with a few days of our ordering in spite of the pandemic. After about a month or more of use, here are our observations.

1. The Panasonic fits the requirements we had perfectly.
2. It is at a nice price point. Just around 10K.
3. It works well on whatever tasks we have put it to. It grills, heats, and cooks food perfectly.
4. It does not make to much noise, and the beep it sounds upon completion is what we are used to in Sharp.
5. We were used to have a number keyboard in the Sharp. This does not have it. But it takes only a few moments for us to get used to the new controls in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds.
6. The timer and clock are the same button. To set the time you press the button once. To set the clock, you keep the button pressed for a few seconds and you get the 24H display. You can then set the clock.
7. The Panasonic microwave is a little light in weight. We have kept it atop a rubber mat so that it does not move.
8. Panasonic sent it's engineer the same day the product arrived. He was a little disappointed we had already set the microwave up, and had started using it. But he quickly took a deep breath, and explained the features to us. It is a different matter we knew more about the product then he, as we had read the manual thoroughly a few times.
9. The manual is well written and enough for you to understand how to use the microwave.
10. We are, in general, happy with the choice and have started enjoying using the Panasonic Microwave.

The only issue, if at all any, is that since it does not have a number pad, you can set the timer for say, 17 seconds. It has to be in multiple of 10 seconds. But that is manageable.

Misamo Enterprise PVC Wall Hooks, Pack of 15, Transparent,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased another set of these and I still got no negative feedback. It's a good product and it's perfect for people who live on rent. The process of drilling and having hooks can be lengthy, this saves time and money of course.

These hooks have been a lifesaver in my life at least. I've been using these for a few years and I can say it does what it claims. Yet I must say, these won't hold a lot of weight. If you using these for plants then you must know, that they won't hold their weight for months. Maybe some may but all of them won't. It's not the adhesive that is weak but the hook, it comes off with weight. Maybe you can use it for a smaller plant but not a heavier one. Be careful if you are trying with a heavier pot.

This is good for hanging towels, hand towels especially. I use this behind the bathroom door cus it sticks perfectly on doors. I don't know how strongly it will hold on to a wooden door but it sticks best on titles, plastic kinda doors. Yes, it does stick strongly on walls as well but as long as your wall is perfectly finished.

So anyway, to conclude with. It's perfect to hold light weight stuff.

Newtone Premium Garbage Bags (Small) Size 43 cm x 51 cm 4 Rolls (120 Bags) (Dustbin Bag/Trash Bag) (Black Color),5.0 out of 5 stars,I am writing this review after using the 30 bags contained in one box. The supply condition is a pack of four boxes having 30 bags each.

Observations:
1. Very good plastic quality. Does not get punctured easily.
2. Able to detach a bag for use from the roll smoothly without need for extra force or care and without damaging the next bag in the roll.
3. Has a tie strap available with each bag and of good quality and strength.
4. Physically measured sizes:
Length=20 inches (51 cm)
Can be comfortably inserted into a bin of
diameter 11 inches (28 cm) and roll the bag
open end over the mouth of the bin.

Very satisfied with the product.

rts Universal Travel Adapter, International All in One Worldwide Travel Adapter and Wall Charger with USB Ports with Multi Type Power Outlet USB 2.1A,100-250 Voltage Travel Charger (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Does a great job. I have three of these that I use in Europe and they work great although the 2-pin (foldable) plug is a bit thin and doesn't fit too snuggly in the socket. I also think the folding mechanism feels a bit weak. Still, I've used these in Europe and India for the past 2 years or so. Recommended.

Good knight Gold Flash Liquid Vapourizer | Mosquito Repellent Refill | Lavender Fragrance | Pack of 4 (45ml each),5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Good Knight Gold Flash Vapourizer for months, and it's super effective against mosquitoes. The lavender fragrance is a nice touch, not too overpowering. Plus, the pack of 4 lasts long, making it great value. Highly recommend for a peaceful, mosquito-free home!

The flash feature seems to be more effective when there’s a sudden increase in mosquitoes. I noticed fewer mosquito bites, even when we keep the windows open for a breeze. It kicks in when you need it most, but it’s not constantly on, so it feels like it’s working smarter, not harder.

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,The rechargeable desk lamp is a true gem for anyone looking for a blend of style, functionality, and convenience. The sleek design fits perfectly on any desk, adding a modern touch without taking up too much space.

What really sets it apart is the rechargeable feature—no more hunting for outlets or dealing with tangled cords. The battery life is impressive, lasting through long work sessions or late-night reading. Plus, the adjustable brightness levels cater to every need, whether you want a soft glow or bright light for detailed tasks. I’m fully impressed

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,My bed side reading companion.
Nice product build, light weight with a functional neck hoist, which is easily adjustable and stays at the needed position. The warm light at low illumination can work as a night lamp too. Easy to use touch control. Illumination better when plugged in but battery support is also fairly good.

Tends to topple and needs some weight in the pencil holder part to stay put.

A recent purchase but have used other products from this company and they are good. Hoping this one betters the experience

Reposted this after few months of use and this is going great

The quality of the product is very good and lighting options are quite comfortable to the eye. I have been using it on my work desk but it has versatile usecases. The head is adjustable and the stability of the lamp is also great. The pen and mobile phone holder is an welcoming feature.

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,Product is overall good in this price range. It has three shades and modes which is quite versatile. Material quality is also nice and steady. Although it doesn't have much weight that's why it often falls down when you haven't put anything in the basket. Other than that it's great. Battery life is also impressive.

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,The rechargeable desk lamp is a true gem for anyone looking for a blend of style, functionality, and convenience. The sleek design fits perfectly on any desk, adding a modern touch without taking up too much space.

What really sets it apart is the rechargeable feature—no more hunting for outlets or dealing with tangled cords. The battery life is impressive, lasting through long work sessions or late-night reading. Plus, the adjustable brightness levels cater to every need, whether you want a soft glow or bright light for detailed tasks. I’m fully impressed

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,My bed side reading companion.
Nice product build, light weight with a functional neck hoist, which is easily adjustable and stays at the needed position. The warm light at low illumination can work as a night lamp too. Easy to use touch control. Illumination better when plugged in but battery support is also fairly good.

Tends to topple and needs some weight in the pencil holder part to stay put.

A recent purchase but have used other products from this company and they are good. Hoping this one betters the experience

Reposted this after few months of use and this is going great

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently added WD-40 to my toolbox, and I'm thrilled with its versatility and effectiveness in various applications. Here's why I find this multipurpose spray to be an invaluable asset:

**Multipurpose Marvel:**

It has become my go-to solution, not just at home but also for my vehicle and other commercial uses.

**Powerful Degreasing Agent:**
The spray's prowess extends to effective degreasing. It effortlessly removes grime, grease, and smudges from various surfaces, including wooden tables, countertops, and metallic surfaces of vehicles. This quality makes it a reliable degreasing agent for a variety of applications.

WD-40 is not just a lubricant and degreaser; it's also a formidable cleaning agent. It excels at removing stains, dirt, sticky residues, and dust particles. I've witnessed its effectiveness on automobile parts, cleaning spark plugs, and restoring the shine to rusting showpieces.

**Personal Satisfaction:**
My personal experience with WD-40 has been extremely satisfying, particularly in cleaning my vehicle's chain. It brought back the gleam, making it look as good as new. The ease of use and the wide range of applications have made it an indispensable part of my maintenance routine.

Though these locks were expensive, I was planning to discard it. Then I decided to take a chance and ordered WD-40. It WORKED beautifully. The locks got loosened, almost miraculously! It does not work immediately after spraying. It does not seem to be a lubricant. I sprayed the locks with WD-40 and left them for 10 hours, and then tried to unlock them, it got UNLICKED, as if new!

I bought this with no expectations and very surprised by the results i got. Almost 80-90% of the scratches were removed completely when rubbed well with a microfiber cloth.
If you have scratches on your car, do not doubt a bit and go ahead with this one.

I recently purchased a Polycab geyser, and after several weeks of usage, I can confidently say that it has met and exceeded my expectations in several aspects. Here's a detailed review of the product based on my experience.

Design and Build Quality
The Polycab geyser boasts a sleek and modern design that can easily blend into any bathroom decor. The outer body is made from high-quality, rust-proof materials, which not only gives it a sturdy feel but also ensures durability over time. The size is compact, making it a suitable choice for homes with limited space.

Performance
One of the standout features of the Polycab geyser is its rapid heating capability. It heats water quickly and efficiently, ensuring you have hot water ready in no time, even during peak usage hours. With several options in terms of capacity, it caters to both individual and family needs. The heating element is robust, ensuring consistent performance without compromising on energy efficiency.

Energy Efficiency
Polycab geysers come with advanced insulation technology that helps retain heat for longer periods, reducing the need for constantly reheating water. This feature is great for keeping energy bills in check while still providing a reliable supply of hot water.

Safety Features
Safety is paramount when it comes to appliances like geysers, and Polycab does not disappoint. This model includes multiple safety features, such as an automatic cut-off, thermostat functioning, and a pressure release valve, ensuring safe operation even at higher temperatures.

Ease of Installation
Installing the Polycab geyser was a straightforward process. The user manual provided clear instructions, and I faced no issues during the installation phase. The compact design made it easy to mount in my bathroom without any complicated setup.

Customer Support
Polycab has a reputation for good customer service, and my experience was no different. I had a few queries regarding installation and operation, and the support team was prompt, friendly, and helpful in addressing my concerns.

Value for Money
In terms of pricing, the Polycab geyser is reasonably priced considering the features and performance it offers. It is a worthy investment for anyone looking for a reliable hot water solution without breaking the bank.

Conclusion
Overall, I am highly satisfied with my Polycab geyser. It delivers on all fronts—design, performance, safety, and efficiency.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,5.0 out of 5 stars,That sounds like a great product! I recently purchased bamboo tissues, and I am thoroughly impressed with their quality. Unlike regular paper tissues, these bamboo tissues are incredibly soft and durable. One of the standout features is that a single tissue lasts much longer, reducing waste significantly. This makes them not only a more sustainable choice but also a cost-effective one. I highly recommend these bamboo tissues for anyone looking for a soft, eco-friendly alternative to paper tissues.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,4.0 out of 5 stars,To start, this product's packaging is minimal and crafted from recycled materials, showcasing the company's dedication to sustainability. The tissues themselves are created from 100% natural bamboo, a highly renewable resource that is more environmentally conscious than traditional wood pulp.

Upon my initial use of the tissues, I was pleasantly surprised by their softness and gentle touch on my skin. Often, eco-friendly products can be abrasive and rough, but these tissues are luxuriously soft. Moreover, they possess a 2-ply design, making them sturdy and long-lasting. In the past, I have used other environmentally friendly tissues that easily tore or disintegrated, but these hold up well and leave no residue.

I am also thrilled that this pack contains 100 pulls per box, eliminating the need for frequent restocking. Furthermore, with a pack of 6, I have an ample supply of tissues to last me a considerable amount of time.

What I appreciate most about these tissues is that they are not only beneficial to the environment, but they are also beneficial to my skin. As someone with sensitive skin, I often react to harsh chemicals and fragrances, but these tissues contain no harmful additives.

Overall, I highly recommend the Beco Bamboo Super Soft Facial Tissue for anyone seeking a sustainable and gentle solution for their facial tissue needs. It is a small change that can have a significant impact on the environment, and it is a product that I will continue to purchase in the future.

NEWISH Pepper Spray for self Defence Small Pocket Size - Reliable and Effective Self-Defense 50 Time Spray,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this Red Cop Pepper Spray for self defence after reading some positive reviews on Amazon. I was looking for effective spray that could protect me from thieves and criminals at night. I have to say that this product has exceeded my expectations.

The spray is very easy to use and has a good range of about upto 15 feet. The nozzle always points towards the attacker's face, which ensures accuracy and prevents accidental spraying.

The spray is also very handy and can be placed anywhere, with just little space allocation. I usually carry it in my pocket, and sometimes in my bag. The spray is legal to use. I felt very safe and confident with this spray.

Overall, I am very satisfied with this Red Cop Pepper spray for self defence. It is a powerful and affordable product that gives me peace of mind and security. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to protect themselves from harm.

NEWISH Pepper Spray for self Defence Small Pocket Size - Reliable and Effective Self-Defense 50 Time Spray,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this Red Cop Pepper Spray for self defence after reading some positive reviews on Amazon. I was looking for effective spray that could protect me from thieves and criminals at night. I have to say that this product has exceeded my expectations.

The spray is very easy to use and has a good range of about upto 15 feet. The nozzle always points towards the attacker's face, which ensures accuracy and prevents accidental spraying.

The spray is also very handy and can be placed anywhere, with just little space allocation. I usually carry it in my pocket, and sometimes in my bag. The spray is legal to use. I felt very safe and confident with this spray.

Overall, I am very satisfied with this Red Cop Pepper spray for self defence. It is a powerful and affordable product that gives me peace of mind and security. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to protect themselves from harm.

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),5.0 out of 5 stars,** First Impression **
● The shuttle is yellow in colour with green band at the base. The shuttle base is cork with nylon covering and the skirts are also nylon
● This comes in a carton tube with 6 shuttles packed. The carton has holograms
● The shuttles are manufactured in Japan and is imported by Sunrise Sports

** Product Verification **
● A lot of reviews here say that they think they have got a counterfeit product. You can verify your purchase at Yonex website using the serial number
● The serial number can be revealed by scratching the hologram label. Goto the website 'sunrisetnt' and enter this code there; it's case-sensitive. The site will tell you whether your purchase is genuine or not

** Performance **
● I am an amateur and play on outdoor clay court
● I play with green cap, which is slower in comparison with other caps. However after one or two games, the difference in behaviour disappears
● The recovery of shuttle after the shot is very fast and a problem with this has never been experienced or noted during the play
● The performance in flight path is also not something that gets noticed or influencing while playing badminton as an amateur
● I have been mostly using 350 and a shuttle lasts for around 10 to 15 games before it starts showing signs of disintegration. I replace the shuttle when the first crack appears on the skirt

** Major Differences between popular Shuttlecocks **
● Mavis 10
- Mavis 10 has a nylon base, other shuttles compared here have cork base. So, this lasts longer and best suited for practise sessions
- The flight performance has the least resemblance to feather shuttles. So if you practise for tournaments, I suggest not to use this. If you are a beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is a good choice
● Mavis 300 & 350
- Both these have cork base and nylon feathers
- These shuttles are a tad slower than Mavis 10 and behaviour is closer to feather shuttles in performance when compared with 10
- If you are an amateur who is serious about badminton, this is the best shuttles for you to purchase
- Most of the badminton trainers and coaching centers use either 300 or 350
- I could not experience any difference between 300 and 350, but many people think 350 is better in terms of flight path and durability and my choice of shuttles are 350
● Mavis 500
- This has got cork base and nylon feathers
- These are closer to feather shuttles in terms of flight behaviour & feel than 300/350 and the rate at which it slows down is faster. These shuttles provide more precision & control, and obviously are costlier
- Having said all these, you may not be able to spot much difference even if you are an advanced amateur. However, I have observed that the skirt starts cracking quicker than 350
● Mavis 2000
- This has got the best flight behaviour of all the above and is mostly used for tournaments if feather shuttle is not used. These shuttles are light and the speed & sturdiness are the closest to feather shuttles
● Feather Shuttles
- Nylon shuttlecocks can never match the flight behaviour of feather shuttles. If you want to gain clear control, feel, touch and master different strokes, you have to play on feather shuttles
- One of the major differences in behaviour with nylon shuttles is the dramatic slowing down of feather shuttles. Professionals and serious badminton players use feather shuttles that helps them gain superior techniques and precision control
● Cap Colour
- The colours on cap indicate the speed of the shuttle. When the climate is hot, the air resistance will be less thus making the shuttle travel faster than in cold conditions. This is compensated by using slower shuttles in hot conditions and faster shuttles in cold conditions
- Green cap is the slowest shuttle. You have to put in more power to push the shuttle to the back of the court. This is more suitable for hot and humid weather or at high altitudes
- Blue cap shuttles have medium speed and is most suited for areas where temperature is around 20 degrees
- Red is the fastest of the three and is best for temperatures around 10 degrees and at low altitudes where the air is denser
- I live in Kerala and I normally pick the green cap
● Shuttle Colour
- Colour of shuttle does not have any significance. Yellow shuttles have got more visibility over the white ones

** Summary **
● All these shuttles look almost the same. The main physical difference you can see is the size of holes in the mesh on the shuttle skirt. There are other differences in the cap material, weight of the cap, etc. that determines the behaviour of the shuttle
● If you are an amateur beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is enough which is cheaper and have the most life
● 300 or 350 is best suited if you are amateur but a serious gamer. I don't really know the difference between 300 and 350, but many people say 350 is a better one
● 500 is recommended if you want to experience shuttle behaviour closer to feathers as an amateur
● 2000 is recommended for aspiring professionals incase you don't have the luxury to practise with feathers
● Having said all these, I have to disclaim that this is from my own experience of playing the game and other players I have spoken with have different opinions, especially on the difference between 300, 350 and 500.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic, and my experience has been somewhat mixed.

First, the positives: The scale is indeed portable and compact, making it easy to store in my kitchen drawer without taking up too much space. It's lightweight, which adds to its portability, and the design is sleek and modern, which fits well with my kitchen decor. The digital display is clear and easy to read, and the scale is user-friendly with simple controls.

However, there are several drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. The accuracy of the scale is quite disappointing, with a margin of error of about ±3 grams. For precise measurements, especially in baking or other culinary activities where accuracy is crucial, this can be quite problematic. I found myself needing to double-check measurements with another scale to ensure accuracy.

Additionally, the material quality leaves much to be desired. The scale is made of low-quality plastic, which feels flimsy and not particularly durable. I'm concerned about its longevity, especially with regular use in a busy kitchen environment. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will last very long without developing cracks or other signs of wear and tear.

In summary, while the beatXP Kitchen Scale has some convenient features and an attractive design, its lack of accuracy and low-quality materials are significant downsides. If precision and durability are important to you, you might want to consider other options on the market.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,The beatXP Kitchen Scale KS106 is an adequate product for its price. It's a basic kitchen scale that does the job, but it doesn't exceed expectations. The scale offers decent accuracy and is easy to use, making it a practical choice for those on a budget. However, the build quality and features are quite basic, which is understandable given its low cost.

If you're looking for something that just works without any bells and whistles, this scale fits the bill. But if you require more precision or durability, you might want to consider investing in a higher-end model. Overall, it's an okay product that delivers fair value for its cost.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic, and my experience has been somewhat mixed.

First, the positives: The scale is indeed portable and compact, making it easy to store in my kitchen drawer without taking up too much space. It's lightweight, which adds to its portability, and the design is sleek and modern, which fits well with my kitchen decor. The digital display is clear and easy to read, and the scale is user-friendly with simple controls.

However, there are several drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. The accuracy of the scale is quite disappointing, with a margin of error of about ±3 grams. For precise measurements, especially in baking or other culinary activities where accuracy is crucial, this can be quite problematic. I found myself needing to double-check measurements with another scale to ensure accuracy.

Additionally, the material quality leaves much to be desired. The scale is made of low-quality plastic, which feels flimsy and not particularly durable. I'm concerned about its longevity, especially with regular use in a busy kitchen environment. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will last very long without developing cracks or other signs of wear and tear.

In summary, while the beatXP Kitchen Scale has some convenient features and an attractive design, its lack of accuracy and low-quality materials are significant downsides. If precision and durability are important to you, you might want to consider other options on the market.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,The beatXP Kitchen Scale KS106 is an adequate product for its price. It's a basic kitchen scale that does the job, but it doesn't exceed expectations. The scale offers decent accuracy and is easy to use, making it a practical choice for those on a budget. However, the build quality and features are quite basic, which is understandable given its low cost.

If you're looking for something that just works without any bells and whistles, this scale fits the bill. But if you require more precision or durability, you might want to consider investing in a higher-end model. Overall, it's an okay product that delivers fair value for its cost.

Material is thin, so may not keep dampness out. Also there is no handle - difficult to move it once filled with clothes.

Homestrap Set of 6 Non-Woven Printed Saree Cover/Cloth Storage/Wardrobe Organizer For Clothes with Transparent Window (Grey)(Shark Tank Featured),4.0 out of 5 stars,I had ordered the set 1-2 yrs before and that bags wer so good.. so this time I ordered again and found the bags very faulty.. almost every bag had the same issue.. the ends near zip are open..which can torn it easily..

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,5.0 out of 5 stars,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I cannot express how thrilled I am with my recent purchase of the Amazon basics Egg Boiler! This little appliance has truly transformed my mornings and simplified my meal prep routine.

First and foremost, let's talk about efficiency. This egg boiler is lightning-fast, delivering perfectly cooked eggs in a matter of minutes. Whether I'm craving a soft-boiled egg with a gooey center or a firm hard-boiled egg for my salads, this device consistently delivers flawless results every single time.

The simplicity of operation is another standout feature. With just a push of a button, I can select my desired level of doneness and let the egg boiler work its magic. No more hovering over a pot of boiling water, hoping for consistent results. This device takes the guesswork out of egg cooking, which is a game-changer for busy mornings.

Clean-up is a breeze with the removable parts being dishwasher-safe, saving me precious time and effort. The compact design also makes storage a non-issue, fitting perfectly in my kitchen cabinet without taking up too much space.

Additionally, I appreciate the thoughtful design elements incorporated into this egg boiler. The automatic shut-off feature ensures safety and prevents overcooking, giving me peace of mind while multitasking in the kitchen.

Overall, the Amazon basics Egg Boiler has exceeded my expectations in every aspect. It's reliable, efficient, and incredibly easy to use. If you're looking to streamline your breakfast routine and achieve consistently perfect eggs, look no further than this fantastic appliance. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable egg-cooking solution.

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a good product. Before this gas stove was used in my home. Near about 20 minutes of waste LPG gas for boilling the egg. But, this product takes only 5> to <10 minutes to boil the 7 eggs together.
But, this has 3 draw back.
1) After autoshut the boiler. If I forget to switch off the plug, after some times the boiler gets auto on.
2) Unable to make half-boil eggs with this product, even folloing the instruction to the letter.
3) Unable to crack the top of the eggs as instructed. Egg shell is very tough, it's not easy to drill. So much force and the eggs will shattered.

Pidilite Terminator Eco-Friendly Termite Killer Spray| Wood Preservative and Termite, Borer, Insect Repellant Spray| For Home, Kitchen and Offices (1 Ltr),4.0 out of 5 stars,This is like a life saver. Our rented flat has termites in the wood and cabinets. The landlord though did get it treated but it comes back. It's an year now that I am using it . It is very effective. You can see the effectiveness with once spray and the termites lay dead. But you need to spray periodically to maintain it effectiveness.

Cons - Bad and pungent smell that lasts quite a while. The knozzel of the bottle is so bad it stops working after a while. So I transfer it to my own spray bottle.

Other then that it's a good and effective product.

Panasonic 23 L Convection Microwave Oven(NN-CT353BFDG,Black Mirror, 360° Heat Wrap, Magic Grill),4.0 out of 5 stars,Recently we had to replace our Sharp Microwave oven that had given us stellar service for over 15 years. After a detailed comparison of products from multiple manufacturers, we decided to opt for the Panasonic 23L Convection Microwave Oven (model number NN-CT353BFDG). The reason we chose this against the others were the following:

1. We wanted a full function microwave around 21L in size. The functions we needed include grilling, reheating, defrosting, cooking, etc.
2. We wanted a microwave that was able to distribute the heat across the food kept inside.
3. Of course, we wanted one that is priced reasonably.

As I said before, after extensive research, we ordered for the Panasonic. It arrived with a few days of our ordering in spite of the pandemic. After about a month or more of use, here are our observations.

1. The Panasonic fits the requirements we had perfectly.
2. It is at a nice price point. Just around 10K.
3. It works well on whatever tasks we have put it to. It grills, heats, and cooks food perfectly.
4. It does not make to much noise, and the beep it sounds upon completion is what we are used to in Sharp.
5. We were used to have a number keyboard in the Sharp. This does not have it. But it takes only a few moments for us to get used to the new controls in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds.
6. The timer and clock are the same button. To set the time you press the button once. To set the clock, you keep the button pressed for a few seconds and you get the 24H display. You can then set the clock.
7. The Panasonic microwave is a little light in weight. We have kept it atop a rubber mat so that it does not move.
8. Panasonic sent it's engineer the same day the product arrived. He was a little disappointed we had already set the microwave up, and had started using it. But he quickly took a deep breath, and explained the features to us. It is a different matter we knew more about the product then he, as we had read the manual thoroughly a few times.
9. The manual is well written and enough for you to understand how to use the microwave.
10. We are, in general, happy with the choice and have started enjoying using the Panasonic Microwave.

The only issue, if at all any, is that since it does not have a number pad, you can set the timer for say, 17 seconds. It has to be in multiple of 10 seconds. But that is manageable.

Misamo Enterprise PVC Wall Hooks, Pack of 15, Transparent,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased another set of these and I still got no negative feedback. It's a good product and it's perfect for people who live on rent. The process of drilling and having hooks can be lengthy, this saves time and money of course.

These hooks have been a lifesaver in my life at least. I've been using these for a few years and I can say it does what it claims. Yet I must say, these won't hold a lot of weight. If you using these for plants then you must know, that they won't hold their weight for months. Maybe some may but all of them won't. It's not the adhesive that is weak but the hook, it comes off with weight. Maybe you can use it for a smaller plant but not a heavier one. Be careful if you are trying with a heavier pot.

This is good for hanging towels, hand towels especially. I use this behind the bathroom door cus it sticks perfectly on doors. I don't know how strongly it will hold on to a wooden door but it sticks best on titles, plastic kinda doors. Yes, it does stick strongly on walls as well but as long as your wall is perfectly finished.

So anyway, to conclude with. It's perfect to hold light weight stuff.

rts Universal Travel Adapter, International All in One Worldwide Travel Adapter and Wall Charger with USB Ports with Multi Type Power Outlet USB 2.1A,100-250 Voltage Travel Charger (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Does a great job. I have three of these that I use in Europe and they work great although the 2-pin (foldable) plug is a bit thin and doesn't fit too snuggly in the socket. I also think the folding mechanism feels a bit weak. Still, I've used these in Europe and India for the past 2 years or so. Recommended.

Good knight Gold Flash Liquid Vapourizer | Mosquito Repellent Refill | Lavender Fragrance | Pack of 4 (45ml each),5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Good Knight Gold Flash Vapourizer for months, and it's super effective against mosquitoes. The lavender fragrance is a nice touch, not too overpowering. Plus, the pack of 4 lasts long, making it great value. Highly recommend for a peaceful, mosquito-free home!

The flash feature seems to be more effective when there’s a sudden increase in mosquitoes. I noticed fewer mosquito bites, even when we keep the windows open for a breeze. It kicks in when you need it most, but it’s not constantly on, so it feels like it’s working smarter, not harder.

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,The rechargeable desk lamp is a true gem for anyone looking for a blend of style, functionality, and convenience. The sleek design fits perfectly on any desk, adding a modern touch without taking up too much space.

What really sets it apart is the rechargeable feature—no more hunting for outlets or dealing with tangled cords. The battery life is impressive, lasting through long work sessions or late-night reading. Plus, the adjustable brightness levels cater to every need, whether you want a soft glow or bright light for detailed tasks. I’m fully impressed

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,My bed side reading companion.
Nice product build, light weight with a functional neck hoist, which is easily adjustable and stays at the needed position. The warm light at low illumination can work as a night lamp too. Easy to use touch control. Illumination better when plugged in but battery support is also fairly good.

Tends to topple and needs some weight in the pencil holder part to stay put.

A recent purchase but have used other products from this company and they are good. Hoping this one betters the experience

Reposted this after few months of use and this is going great

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,My bed side reading companion.
Nice product build, light weight with a functional neck hoist, which is easily adjustable and stays at the needed position. The warm light at low illumination can work as a night lamp too. Easy to use touch control. Illumination better when plugged in but battery support is also fairly good.

Tends to topple and needs some weight in the pencil holder part to stay put.

A recent purchase but have used other products from this company and they are good. Hoping this one betters the experience

Reposted this after few months of use and this is going great

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,I have been using the table lamp and the lighting is very good. The quality of the product is very good and lighting options are quite comfortable to the eye. I have been using it on my work desk but it has versatile usecases. The head is adjustable and the stability of the lamp is also great. The pen and mobile phone holder is an welcoming feature.

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,Product is overall good in this price range. It has three shades and modes which is quite versatile. Material quality is also nice and steady. Although it doesn't have much weight that's why it often falls down when you haven't put anything in the basket. Other than that it's great. Battery life is also impressive.

Polycab Superia 5-Star, 10L Water Heater (Geyser), Enhanced Safety, Rust Proof Tank | Free Installation | 5 years tank & 2 years product warranty | Temperature Control Knob, Efficient Heating 【White】,5.0 out of 5 stars,Polycab Geyser Review

I recently purchased a Polycab geyser, and after several weeks of usage, I can confidently say that it has met and exceeded my expectations in several aspects. Here's a detailed review of the product based on my experience.

Design and Build Quality
The Polycab geyser boasts a sleek and modern design that can easily blend into any bathroom decor. The outer body is made from high-quality, rust-proof materials, which not only gives it a sturdy feel but also ensures durability over time. The size is compact, making it a suitable choice for homes with limited space.

Performance
One of the standout features of the Polycab geyser is its rapid heating capability. It heats water quickly and efficiently, ensuring you have hot water ready in no time, even during peak usage hours. With several options in terms of capacity, it caters to both individual and family needs. The heating element is robust, ensuring consistent performance without compromising on energy efficiency.

Energy Efficiency
Polycab geysers come with advanced insulation technology that helps retain heat for longer periods, reducing the need for constantly reheating water. This feature is great for keeping energy bills in check while still providing a reliable supply of hot water.

Safety Features

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,5.0 out of 5 stars,That sounds like a great product! I recently purchased bamboo tissues, and I am thoroughly impressed with their quality. Unlike regular paper tissues, these bamboo tissues are incredibly soft and durable. One of the standout features is that a single tissue lasts much longer, reducing waste significantly. This makes them not only a more sustainable choice but also a cost-effective one. I highly recommend these bamboo tissues for anyone looking for a soft, eco-friendly alternative to paper tissues.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,4.0 out of 5 stars,To start, this product's packaging is minimal and crafted from recycled materials, showcasing the company's dedication to sustainability. The tissues themselves are created from 100% natural bamboo, a highly renewable resource that is more environmentally conscious than traditional wood pulp.

Upon my initial use of the tissues, I was pleasantly surprised by their softness and gentle touch on my skin. Often, eco-friendly products can be abrasive and rough, but these tissues are luxuriously soft. Moreover, they possess a 2-ply design, making them sturdy and long-lasting. In the past, I have used other environmentally friendly tissues that easily tore or disintegrated, but these hold up well and leave no residue.

I am also thrilled that this pack contains 100 pulls per box, eliminating the need for frequent restocking. Furthermore, with a pack of 6, I have an ample supply of tissues to last me a considerable amount of time.

What I appreciate most about these tissues is that they are not only beneficial to the environment, but they are also beneficial to my skin. As someone with sensitive skin, I often react to harsh chemicals and fragrances, but these tissues contain no harmful additives.

Overall, I highly recommend the Beco Bamboo Super Soft Facial Tissue for anyone seeking a sustainable and gentle solution for their facial tissue needs. It is a small change that can have a significant impact on the environment, and it is a product that I will continue to purchase in the future.

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),5.0 out of 5 stars,** First Impression **
● The shuttle is yellow in colour with green band at the base. The shuttle base is cork with nylon covering and the skirts are also nylon
● This comes in a carton tube with 6 shuttles packed. The carton has holograms
● The shuttles are manufactured in Japan and is imported by Sunrise Sports

** Product Verification **
● A lot of reviews here say that they think they have got a counterfeit product. You can verify your purchase at Yonex website using the serial number
● The serial number can be revealed by scratching the hologram label. Goto the website 'sunrisetnt' and enter this code there; it's case-sensitive. The site will tell you whether your purchase is genuine or not

** Performance **
● I am an amateur and play on outdoor clay court
● I play with green cap, which is slower in comparison with other caps. However after one or two games, the difference in behaviour disappears
● The recovery of shuttle after the shot is very fast and a problem with this has never been experienced or noted during the play
● The performance in flight path is also not something that gets noticed or influencing while playing badminton as an amateur
● I have been mostly using 350 and a shuttle lasts for around 10 to 15 games before it starts showing signs of disintegration. I replace the shuttle when the first crack appears on the skirt

** Major Differences between popular Shuttlecocks **
● Mavis 10
- Mavis 10 has a nylon base, other shuttles compared here have cork base. So, this lasts longer and best suited for practise sessions
- The flight performance has the least resemblance to feather shuttles. So if you practise for tournaments, I suggest not to use this. If you are a beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is a good choice
● Mavis 300 & 350
- Both these have cork base and nylon feathers
- These shuttles are a tad slower than Mavis 10 and behaviour is closer to feather shuttles in performance when compared with 10
- If you are an amateur who is serious about badminton, this is the best shuttles for you to purchase
- Most of the badminton trainers and coaching centers use either 300 or 350
- I could not experience any difference between 300 and 350, but many people think 350 is better in terms of flight path and durability and my choice of shuttles are 350
● Mavis 500
- This has got cork base and nylon feathers
- These are closer to feather shuttles in terms of flight behaviour & feel than 300/350 and the rate at which it slows down is faster. These shuttles provide more precision & control, and obviously are costlier
- Having said all these, you may not be able to spot much difference even if you are an advanced amateur. However, I have observed that the skirt starts cracking quicker than 350
● Mavis 2000
- This has got the best flight behaviour of all the above and is mostly used for tournaments if feather shuttle is not used. These shuttles are light and the speed & sturdiness are the closest to feather shuttles
● Feather Shuttles
- Nylon shuttlecocks can never match the flight behaviour of feather shuttles. If you want to gain clear control, feel, touch and master different strokes, you have to play on feather shuttles
- One of the major differences in behaviour with nylon shuttles is the dramatic slowing down of feather shuttles. Professionals and serious badminton players use feather shuttles that helps them gain superior techniques and precision control
● Cap Colour
- The colours on cap indicate the speed of the shuttle. When the climate is hot, the air resistance will be less thus making the shuttle travel faster than in cold conditions. This is compensated by using slower shuttles in hot conditions and faster shuttles in cold conditions
- Green cap is the slowest shuttle. You have to put in more power to push the shuttle to the back of the court. This is more suitable for hot and humid weather or at high altitudes
- Blue cap shuttles have medium speed and is most suited for areas where temperature is around 20 degrees
- Red is the fastest of the three and is best for temperatures around 10 degrees and at low altitudes where the air is denser
- I live in Kerala and I normally pick the green cap
● Shuttle Colour
- Colour of shuttle does not have any significance. Yellow shuttles have got more visibility over the white ones

** Summary **
● All these shuttles look almost the same. The main physical difference you can see is the size of holes in the mesh on the shuttle skirt. There are other differences in the cap material, weight of the cap, etc. that determines the behaviour of the shuttle
● If you are an amateur beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is enough which is cheaper and have the most life
● 300 or 350 is best suited if you are amateur but a serious gamer. I don't really know the difference between 300 and 350, but many people say 350 is a better one
● 500 is recommended if you want to experience shuttle behaviour closer to feathers as an amateur
● 2000 is recommended for aspiring professionals incase you don't have the luxury to practise with feathers
● Having said all these, I have to disclaim that this is from my own experience of playing the game and other players I have spoken with have different opinions, especially on the difference between 300, 350 and 500.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic, and my experience has been somewhat mixed.

First, the positives: The scale is indeed portable and compact, making it easy to store in my kitchen drawer without taking up too much space. It's lightweight, which adds to its portability, and the design is sleek and modern, which fits well with my kitchen decor. The digital display is clear and easy to read, and the scale is user-friendly with simple controls.

However, there are several drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. The accuracy of the scale is quite disappointing, with a margin of error of about ±3 grams. For precise measurements, especially in baking or other culinary activities where accuracy is crucial, this can be quite problematic. I found myself needing to double-check measurements with another scale to ensure accuracy.

Additionally, the material quality leaves much to be desired. The scale is made of low-quality plastic, which feels flimsy and not particularly durable. I'm concerned about its longevity, especially with regular use in a busy kitchen environment. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will last very long without developing cracks or other signs of wear and tear.

In summary, while the beatXP Kitchen Scale has some convenient features and an attractive design, its lack of accuracy and low-quality materials are significant downsides. If precision and durability are important to you, you might want to consider other options on the market.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,The beatXP Kitchen Scale KS106 is an adequate product for its price. It's a basic kitchen scale that does the job, but it doesn't exceed expectations. The scale offers decent accuracy and is easy to use, making it a practical choice for those on a budget. However, the build quality and features are quite basic, which is understandable given its low cost.

If you're looking for something that just works without any bells and whistles, this scale fits the bill. But if you require more precision or durability, you might want to consider investing in a higher-end model. Overall, it's an okay product that delivers fair value for its cost.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic, and my experience has been somewhat mixed.

First, the positives: The scale is indeed portable and compact, making it easy to store in my kitchen drawer without taking up too much space. It's lightweight, which adds to its portability, and the design is sleek and modern, which fits well with my kitchen decor. The digital display is clear and easy to read, and the scale is user-friendly with simple controls.

However, there are several drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. The accuracy of the scale is quite disappointing, with a margin of error of about ±3 grams. For precise measurements, especially in baking or other culinary activities where accuracy is crucial, this can be quite problematic. I found myself needing to double-check measurements with another scale to ensure accuracy.

Additionally, the material quality leaves much to be desired. The scale is made of low-quality plastic, which feels flimsy and not particularly durable. I'm concerned about its longevity, especially with regular use in a busy kitchen environment. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will last very long without developing cracks or other signs of wear and tear.

In summary, while the beatXP Kitchen Scale has some convenient features and an attractive design, its lack of accuracy and low-quality materials are significant downsides. If precision and durability are important to you, you might want to consider other options on the market.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,The beatXP Kitchen Scale KS106 is an adequate product for its price. It's a basic kitchen scale that does the job, but it doesn't exceed expectations. The scale offers decent accuracy and is easy to use, making it a practical choice for those on a budget. However, the build quality and features are quite basic, which is understandable given its low cost.

If you're looking for something that just works without any bells and whistles, this scale fits the bill. But if you require more precision or durability, you might want to consider investing in a higher-end model. Overall, it's an okay product that delivers fair value for its cost.

Material is thin, so may not keep dampness out. Also there is no handle - difficult to move it once filled with clothes.

Homestrap Set of 6 Non-Woven Printed Saree Cover/Cloth Storage/Wardrobe Organizer For Clothes with Transparent Window (Grey)(Shark Tank Featured),4.0 out of 5 stars,I had ordered the set 1-2 yrs before and that bags wer so good.. so this time I ordered again and found the bags very faulty.. almost every bag had the same issue.. the ends near zip are open..which can torn it easily..
Hence I would say to the seller to kindly check ur every single product before dispatching them..

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,5.0 out of 5 stars,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I cannot express how thrilled I am with my recent purchase of the Amazon basics Egg Boiler! This little appliance has truly transformed my mornings and simplified my meal prep routine.

First and foremost, let's talk about efficiency. This egg boiler is lightning-fast, delivering perfectly cooked eggs in a matter of minutes. Whether I'm craving a soft-boiled egg with a gooey center or a firm hard-boiled egg for my salads, this device consistently delivers flawless results every single time.

The simplicity of operation is another standout feature. With just a push of a button, I can select my desired level of doneness and let the egg boiler work its magic. No more hovering over a pot of boiling water, hoping for consistent results. This device takes the guesswork out of egg cooking, which is a game-changer for busy mornings.

Clean-up is a breeze with the removable parts being dishwasher-safe, saving me precious time and effort. The compact design also makes storage a non-issue, fitting perfectly in my kitchen cabinet without taking up too much space.

Additionally, I appreciate the thoughtful design elements incorporated into this egg boiler. The automatic shut-off feature ensures safety and prevents overcooking, giving me peace of mind while multitasking in the kitchen.

Overall, the Amazon basics Egg Boiler has exceeded my expectations in every aspect. It's reliable, efficient, and incredibly easy to use. If you're looking to streamline your breakfast routine and achieve consistently perfect eggs, look no further than this fantastic appliance. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable egg-cooking solution.

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a good product. Before this gas stove was used in my home. Near about 20 minutes of waste LPG gas for boilling the egg. But, this product takes only 5> to <10 minutes to boil the 7 eggs together.
But, this has 3 draw back.
1) After autoshut the boiler. If I forget to switch off the plug, after some times the boiler gets auto on.
2) Unable to make half-boil eggs with this product, even folloing the instruction to the letter.
3) Unable to crack the top of the eggs as instructed. Egg shell is very tough, it's not easy to drill. So much force and the eggs will shattered.

Pidilite Terminator Eco-Friendly Termite Killer Spray| Wood Preservative and Termite, Borer, Insect Repellant Spray| For Home, Kitchen and Offices (1 Ltr),4.0 out of 5 stars,This is like a life saver. Our rented flat has termites in the wood and cabinets. The landlord though did get it treated but it comes back. It's an year now that I am using it . It is very effective. You can see the effectiveness with once spray and the termites lay dead. But you need to spray periodically to maintain it effectiveness.

Cons - Bad and pungent smell that lasts quite a while. The knozzel of the bottle is so bad it stops working after a while. So I transfer it to my own spray bottle.

Other then that it's a good and effective product.

Kitchenwell Multi-Purpose Trolley Storage Organizer and Kitchen Accessories Items for Kitchen Storage Rack Square Design Fruits & Vegetable Onion Cutlery (Matt Black, 3 Layer Drawer),5.0 out of 5 stars,It's easy to assemble, storage wise one box holds almost 5 kg of onion,
Paint is okay okay
Base isn't even so it won't stay firm goes off balance one side ( manageable, still could be better)
While wheels being fixed on it works fine
Looks classy in kitchen like an upgrade and vegetables won't be messy looking from out it's all stored inside making kitchen bit cleaner

Overall would recommend it

Kitchenwell Multi-Purpose Trolley Storage Organizer and Kitchen Accessories Items for Kitchen Storage Rack Square Design Fruits & Vegetable Onion Cutlery (Matt Black, 3 Layer Drawer),3.0 out of 5 stars,The trolley is stylish and useful for holding bulky items, which is why I enjoy it. The wheels are the one thing I didn't like; they are push-on and easily come off when you elevate the trolley.

Panasonic 23 L Convection Microwave Oven(NN-CT353BFDG,Black Mirror, 360° Heat Wrap, Magic Grill),4.0 out of 5 stars,Recently we had to replace our Sharp Microwave oven that had given us stellar service for over 15 years. After a detailed comparison of products from multiple manufacturers, we decided to opt for the Panasonic 23L Convection Microwave Oven (model number NN-CT353BFDG). The reason we chose this against the others were the following:

1. We wanted a full function microwave around 21L in size. The functions we needed include grilling, reheating, defrosting, cooking, etc.
2. We wanted a microwave that was able to distribute the heat across the food kept inside.
3. Of course, we wanted one that is priced reasonably.

As I said before, after extensive research, we ordered for the Panasonic. It arrived with a few days of our ordering in spite of the pandemic. After about a month or more of use, here are our observations.

1. The Panasonic fits the requirements we had perfectly.
2. It is at a nice price point. Just around 10K.
3. It works well on whatever tasks we have put it to. It grills, heats, and cooks food perfectly.
4. It does not make to much noise, and the beep it sounds upon completion is what we are used to in Sharp.
5. We were used to have a number keyboard in the Sharp. This does not have it. But it takes only a few moments for us to get used to the new controls in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds.
6. The timer and clock are the same button. To set the time you press the button once. To set the clock, you keep the button pressed for a few seconds and you get the 24H display. You can then set the clock.
7. The Panasonic microwave is a little light in weight. We have kept it atop a rubber mat so that it does not move.
8. Panasonic sent it's engineer the same day the product arrived. He was a little disappointed we had already set the microwave up, and had started using it. But he quickly took a deep breath, and explained the features to us. It is a different matter we knew more about the product then he, as we had read the manual thoroughly a few times.
9. The manual is well written and enough for you to understand how to use the microwave.
10. We are, in general, happy with the choice and have started enjoying using the Panasonic Microwave.

The only issue, if at all any, is that since it does not have a number pad, you can set the timer for say, 17 seconds. It has to be in multiple of 10 seconds. But that is manageable.

Misamo Enterprise PVC Wall Hooks, Pack of 15, Transparent,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased another set of these and I still got no negative feedback. It's a good product and it's perfect for people who live on rent. The process of drilling and having hooks can be lengthy, this saves time and money of course.

These hooks have been a lifesaver in my life at least. I've been using these for a few years and I can say it does what it claims. Yet I must say, these won't hold a lot of weight. If you using these for plants then you must know, that they won't hold their weight for months. Maybe some may but all of them won't. It's not the adhesive that is weak but the hook, it comes off with weight. Maybe you can use it for a smaller plant but not a heavier one. Be careful if you are trying with a heavier pot.

This is good for hanging towels, hand towels especially. I use this behind the bathroom door cus it sticks perfectly on doors. I don't know how strongly it will hold on to a wooden door but it sticks best on titles, plastic kinda doors. Yes, it does stick strongly on walls as well but as long as your wall is perfectly finished.

So anyway, to conclude with. It's perfect to hold light weight stuff.

2. Able to detach a bag for use from the roll smoothly without need for extra force or care and without damaging the next bag in the roll.
3. Has a tie strap available with each bag and of good quality and strength.
4. Physically measured sizes:
Length=20 inches (51 cm)
Can be comfortably inserted into a bin of
diameter 11 inches (28 cm) and roll the bag
open end over the mouth of the bin.

Very satisfied with the product.

rts Universal Travel Adapter, International All in One Worldwide Travel Adapter and Wall Charger with USB Ports with Multi Type Power Outlet USB 2.1A,100-250 Voltage Travel Charger (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Does a great job. I have three of these that I use in Europe and they work great although the 2-pin (foldable) plug is a bit thin and doesn't fit too snuggly in the socket. I also think the folding mechanism feels a bit weak. Still, I've used these in Europe and India for the past 2 years or so. Recommended.

Good knight Gold Flash Liquid Vapourizer | Mosquito Repellent Refill | Lavender Fragrance | Pack of 4 (45ml each),5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Good Knight Gold Flash Vapourizer for months, and it's super effective against mosquitoes. The lavender fragrance is a nice touch, not too overpowering. Plus, the pack of 4 lasts long, making it great value. Highly recommend for a peaceful, mosquito-free home!

The flash feature seems to be more effective when there’s a sudden increase in mosquitoes. I noticed fewer mosquito bites, even when we keep the windows open for a breeze. It kicks in when you need it most, but it’s not constantly on, so it feels like it’s working smarter, not harder.

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,The rechargeable desk lamp is a true gem for anyone looking for a blend of style, functionality, and convenience. The sleek design fits perfectly on any desk, adding a modern touch without taking up too much space.

What really sets it apart is the rechargeable feature—no more hunting for outlets or dealing with tangled cords. The battery life is impressive, lasting through long work sessions or late-night reading. Plus, the adjustable brightness levels cater to every need, whether you want a soft glow or bright light for detailed tasks. I’m fully impressed

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,My bed side reading companion.
Nice product build, light weight with a functional neck hoist, which is easily adjustable and stays at the needed position. The warm light at low illumination can work as a night lamp too. Easy to use touch control. Illumination better when plugged in but battery support is also fairly good.

Tends to topple and needs some weight in the pencil holder part to stay put.

A recent purchase but have used other products from this company and they are good. Hoping this one betters the experience

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,Product is overall good in this price range. It has three shades and modes which is quite versatile. Material quality is also nice and steady. Although it doesn't have much weight that's why it often falls down when you haven't put anything in the basket. Other than that it's great. Battery life is also impressive.

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently added WD-40 to my toolbox, and I'm thrilled with its versatility and effectiveness in various applications. Here's why I find this multipurpose spray to be an invaluable asset:

**Multipurpose Marvel:**

It has become my go-to solution, not just at home but also for my vehicle and other commercial uses.

**Powerful Degreasing Agent:**
The spray's prowess extends to effective degreasing. It effortlessly removes grime, grease, and smudges from various surfaces, including wooden tables, countertops, and metallic surfaces of vehicles. This quality makes it a reliable degreasing agent for a variety of applications.

**Active Cleaning Agent:**
WD-40 is not just a lubricant and degreaser; it's also a formidable cleaning agent. It excels at removing stains, dirt, sticky residues, and dust particles. I've witnessed its effectiveness on automobile parts, cleaning spark plugs, and restoring the shine to rusting showpieces.

**Personal Satisfaction:**
My personal experience with WD-40 has been extremely satisfying, particularly in cleaning my vehicle's chain. It brought back the gleam, making it look as good as new. The ease of use and the wide range of applications have made it an indispensable part of my maintenance routine.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, WD-40 has proven to be a game-changer in home and auto care.

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,I had a couple of Godrej locks whuch got rusted and thus become unusable as they were exposed to rainwater. Though these locks were expensive, I was planning to discard it. Then I decided to take a chance and ordered WD-40. It WORKED beautifully. The locks got loosened, almost miraculously! It does not work immediately after spraying. It does not seem to be a lubricant. I sprayed the locks with WD-40 and left them for 10 hours, and then tried to unlock them, it got UNLICKED, as if new! I recommend it.

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,You can not miss this to have it if you own a car. This thing of a piece works like magic for me. I had so many scratches on my new car and I was very afraid that I might get those parts repainted. I was literally thought of filing a claim as well for those scratches. The one i have attached in media is the smallest one there were many more worse than this.
I bought this with no expectations and very surprised by the results i got. Almost 80-90% of the scratches were removed completely when rubbed well with a microfiber cloth.
If you have scratches on your car, do not doubt a bit and go ahead with this one.

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,You can not miss this to have it if you own a car. This thing of a piece works like magic for me. I had so many scratches on my new car and I was very afraid that I might get those parts repainted. I was literally thought of filing a claim as well for those scratches. The one i have attached in media is the smallest one there were many more worse than this.
I bought this with no expectations and very surprised by the results i got. Almost 80-90% of the scratches were removed completely when rubbed well with a microfiber cloth.
If you have scratches on your car, do not doubt a bit and go ahead with this one.

Installing the Polycab geyser was a straightforward process. The user manual provided clear instructions, and I faced no issues during the installation phase. The compact design made it easy to mount in my bathroom without any complicated setup.

Customer Support
Polycab has a reputation for good customer service, and my experience was no different. I had a few queries regarding installation and operation, and the support team was prompt, friendly, and helpful in addressing my concerns.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,5.0 out of 5 stars,That sounds like a great product! I recently purchased bamboo tissues, and I am thoroughly impressed with their quality. Unlike regular paper tissues, these bamboo tissues are incredibly soft and durable. One of the standout features is that a single tissue lasts much longer, reducing waste significantly. This makes them not only a more sustainable choice but also a cost-effective one. I highly recommend these bamboo tissues for anyone looking for a soft, eco-friendly alternative to paper tissues.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,4.0 out of 5 stars,To start, this product's packaging is minimal and crafted from recycled materials, showcasing the company's dedication to sustainability. The tissues themselves are created from 100% natural bamboo, a highly renewable resource that is more environmentally conscious than traditional wood pulp.

Upon my initial use of the tissues, I was pleasantly surprised by their softness and gentle touch on my skin. Often, eco-friendly products can be abrasive and rough, but these tissues are luxuriously soft. Moreover, they possess a 2-ply design, making them sturdy and long-lasting. In the past, I have used other environmentally friendly tissues that easily tore or disintegrated, but these hold up well and leave no residue.

I am also thrilled that this pack contains 100 pulls per box, eliminating the need for frequent restocking. Furthermore, with a pack of 6, I have an ample supply of tissues to last me a considerable amount of time.

What I appreciate most about these tissues is that they are not only beneficial to the environment, but they are also beneficial to my skin. As someone with sensitive skin, I often react to harsh chemicals and fragrances, but these tissues contain no harmful additives.

Overall, I highly recommend the Beco Bamboo Super Soft Facial Tissue for anyone seeking a sustainable and gentle solution for their facial tissue needs. It is a small change that can have a significant impact on the environment, and it is a product that I will continue to purchase in the future.

NEWISH Pepper Spray for self Defence Small Pocket Size - Reliable and Effective Self-Defense 50 Time Spray,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this for my sister who use to travel frequently.
When we tried this spray at home, within 4-5 secs there was very spicy, itchy and unbearable odour in surrounding that we can't even stand there for 30 seconds. Intensity is very high and unbearable.
Impressed with the performance and it is pocket size so you can easily carry it.
Recommend this to every girl as a first aid for protection.

But please be very careful while using it, don't spray it directly in the eyes of another person until and unless you're in danger because it can cause lose in eye sight.

NEWISH Pepper Spray for self Defence Small Pocket Size - Reliable and Effective Self-Defense 50 Time Spray,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this Red Cop Pepper Spray for self defence after reading some positive reviews on Amazon. I was looking for effective spray that could protect me from thieves and criminals at night. I have to say that this product has exceeded my expectations.

The spray is very easy to use and has a good range of about upto 15 feet. The nozzle always points towards the attacker's face, which ensures accuracy and prevents accidental spraying.

The spray is also very handy and can be placed anywhere, with just little space allocation. I usually carry it in my pocket, and sometimes in my bag. The spray is legal to use. I felt very safe and confident with this spray.

NEWISH Pepper Spray for self Defence Small Pocket Size - Reliable and Effective Self-Defense 50 Time Spray,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this for my sister who use to travel frequently.
When we tried this spray at home, within 4-5 secs there was very spicy, itchy and unbearable odour in surrounding that we can't even stand there for 30 seconds. Intensity is very high and unbearable.
Impressed with the performance and it is pocket size so you can easily carry it.
Recommend this to every girl as a first aid for protection.

But please be very careful while using it, don't spray it directly in the eyes of another person until and unless you're in danger because it can cause lose in eye sight.

NEWISH Pepper Spray for self Defence Small Pocket Size - Reliable and Effective Self-Defense 50 Time Spray,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this Red Cop Pepper Spray for self defence after reading some positive reviews on Amazon. I was looking for effective spray that could protect me from thieves and criminals at night. I have to say that this product has exceeded my expectations.

The spray is very easy to use and has a good range of about upto 15 feet. The nozzle always points towards the attacker's face, which ensures accuracy and prevents accidental spraying.

The spray is also very handy and can be placed anywhere, with just little space allocation. I usually carry it in my pocket, and sometimes in my bag. The spray is legal to use. I felt very safe and confident with this spray.

Overall, I am very satisfied with this Red Cop Pepper spray for self defence. It is a powerful and affordable product that gives me peace of mind and security. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to protect themselves from harm.

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),5.0 out of 5 stars,** First Impression **
● The shuttle is yellow in colour with green band at the base. The shuttle base is cork with nylon covering and the skirts are also nylon
● This comes in a carton tube with 6 shuttles packed. The carton has holograms
● The shuttles are manufactured in Japan and is imported by Sunrise Sports

** Product Verification **
● A lot of reviews here say that they think they have got a counterfeit product. You can verify your purchase at Yonex website using the serial number
● The serial number can be revealed by scratching the hologram label. Goto the website 'sunrisetnt' and enter this code there; it's case-sensitive. The site will tell you whether your purchase is genuine or not

** Performance **
● I am an amateur and play on outdoor clay court
● I play with green cap, which is slower in comparison with other caps. However after one or two games, the difference in behaviour disappears
● The recovery of shuttle after the shot is very fast and a problem with this has never been experienced or noted during the play
● The performance in flight path is also not something that gets noticed or influencing while playing badminton as an amateur
● I have been mostly using 350 and a shuttle lasts for around 10 to 15 games before it starts showing signs of disintegration. I replace the shuttle when the first crack appears on the skirt

** Major Differences between popular Shuttlecocks **
● Mavis 10
- Mavis 10 has a nylon base, other shuttles compared here have cork base. So, this lasts longer and best suited for practise sessions
- The flight performance has the least resemblance to feather shuttles. So if you practise for tournaments, I suggest not to use this. If you are a beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is a good choice
● Mavis 300 & 350
- Both these have cork base and nylon feathers
- These shuttles are a tad slower than Mavis 10 and behaviour is closer to feather shuttles in performance when compared with 10
- If you are an amateur who is serious about badminton, this is the best shuttles for you to purchase
- Most of the badminton trainers and coaching centers use either 300 or 350
- I could not experience any difference between 300 and 350, but many people think 350 is better in terms of flight path and durability and my choice of shuttles are 350
● Mavis 500
- This has got cork base and nylon feathers
- These are closer to feather shuttles in terms of flight behaviour & feel than 300/350 and the rate at which it slows down is faster. These shuttles provide more precision & control, and obviously are costlier
- Having said all these, you may not be able to spot much difference even if you are an advanced amateur. However, I have observed that the skirt starts cracking quicker than 350
● Mavis 2000
- This has got the best flight behaviour of all the above and is mostly used for tournaments if feather shuttle is not used. These shuttles are light and the speed & sturdiness are the closest to feather shuttles
● Feather Shuttles
- Nylon shuttlecocks can never match the flight behaviour of feather shuttles. If you want to gain clear control, feel, touch and master different strokes, you have to play on feather shuttles
- One of the major differences in behaviour with nylon shuttles is the dramatic slowing down of feather shuttles. Professionals and serious badminton players use feather shuttles that helps them gain superior techniques and precision control
● Cap Colour
- The colours on cap indicate the speed of the shuttle. When the climate is hot, the air resistance will be less thus making the shuttle travel faster than in cold conditions. This is compensated by using slower shuttles in hot conditions and faster shuttles in cold conditions
- Green cap is the slowest shuttle. You have to put in more power to push the shuttle to the back of the court. This is more suitable for hot and humid weather or at high altitudes
- Blue cap shuttles have medium speed and is most suited for areas where temperature is around 20 degrees
- Red is the fastest of the three and is best for temperatures around 10 degrees and at low altitudes where the air is denser
- I live in Kerala and I normally pick the green cap
● Shuttle Colour
- Colour of shuttle does not have any significance. Yellow shuttles have got more visibility over the white ones

** Summary **
● All these shuttles look almost the same. The main physical difference you can see is the size of holes in the mesh on the shuttle skirt. There are other differences in the cap material, weight of the cap, etc. that determines the behaviour of the shuttle
● If you are an amateur beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is enough which is cheaper and have the most life
● 300 or 350 is best suited if you are amateur but a serious gamer. I don't really know the difference between 300 and 350, but many people say 350 is a better one
● 500 is recommended if you want to experience shuttle behaviour closer to feathers as an amateur
● 2000 is recommended for aspiring professionals incase you don't have the luxury to practise with feathers
● Having said all these, I have to disclaim that this is from my own experience of playing the game and other players I have spoken with have different opinions, especially on the difference between 300, 350 and 500.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic, and my experience has been somewhat mixed.

First, the positives: The scale is indeed portable and compact, making it easy to store in my kitchen drawer without taking up too much space. It's lightweight, which adds to its portability, and the design is sleek and modern, which fits well with my kitchen decor. The digital display is clear and easy to read, and the scale is user-friendly with simple controls.

However, there are several drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. The accuracy of the scale is quite disappointing, with a margin of error of about ±3 grams. For precise measurements, especially in baking or other culinary activities where accuracy is crucial, this can be quite problematic. I found myself needing to double-check measurements with another scale to ensure accuracy.

Additionally, the material quality leaves much to be desired. The scale is made of low-quality plastic, which feels flimsy and not particularly durable. I'm concerned about its longevity, especially with regular use in a busy kitchen environment. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will last very long without developing cracks or other signs of wear and tear.

In summary, while the beatXP Kitchen Scale has some convenient features and an attractive design, its lack of accuracy and low-quality materials are significant downsides. If precision and durability are important to you, you might want to consider other options on the market.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,The beatXP Kitchen Scale KS106 is an adequate product for its price. It's a basic kitchen scale that does the job, but it doesn't exceed expectations. The scale offers decent accuracy and is easy to use, making it a practical choice for those on a budget. However, the build quality and features are quite basic, which is understandable given its low cost.

If you're looking for something that just works without any bells and whistles, this scale fits the bill. But if you require more precision or durability, you might want to consider investing in a higher-end model. Overall, it's an okay product that delivers fair value for its cost.

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,5.0 out of 5 stars,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I cannot express how thrilled I am with my recent purchase of the Amazon basics Egg Boiler! This little appliance has truly transformed my mornings and simplified my meal prep routine.

First and foremost, let's talk about efficiency. This egg boiler is lightning-fast, delivering perfectly cooked eggs in a matter of minutes. Whether I'm craving a soft-boiled egg with a gooey center or a firm hard-boiled egg for my salads, this device consistently delivers flawless results every single time.

The simplicity of operation is another standout feature. With just a push of a button, I can select my desired level of doneness and let the egg boiler work its magic. No more hovering over a pot of boiling water, hoping for consistent results. This device takes the guesswork out of egg cooking, which is a game-changer for busy mornings.

Clean-up is a breeze with the removable parts being dishwasher-safe, saving me precious time and effort. The compact design also makes storage a non-issue, fitting perfectly in my kitchen cabinet without taking up too much space.

Additionally, I appreciate the thoughtful design elements incorporated into this egg boiler. The automatic shut-off feature ensures safety and prevents overcooking, giving me peace of mind while multitasking in the kitchen.

Overall, the Amazon basics Egg Boiler has exceeded my expectations in every aspect. It's reliable, efficient, and incredibly easy to use. If you're looking to streamline your breakfast routine and achieve consistently perfect eggs, look no further than this fantastic appliance. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable egg-cooking solution.

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a good product. Before this gas stove was used in my home. Near about 20 minutes of waste LPG gas for boilling the egg. But, this product takes only 5> to <10 minutes to boil the 7 eggs together.
But, this has 3 draw back.
1) After autoshut the boiler. If I forget to switch off the plug, after some times the boiler gets auto on.
2) Unable to make half-boil eggs with this product, even folloing the instruction to the letter.
3) Unable to crack the top of the eggs as instructed. Egg shell is very tough, it's not easy to drill. So much force and the eggs will shattered.

Pidilite Terminator Eco-Friendly Termite Killer Spray| Wood Preservative and Termite, Borer, Insect Repellant Spray| For Home, Kitchen and Offices (1 Ltr),4.0 out of 5 stars,This is like a life saver. Our rented flat has termites in the wood and cabinets. The landlord though did get it treated but it comes back. It's an year now that I am using it . It is very effective. You can see the effectiveness with once spray and the termites lay dead. But you need to spray periodically to maintain it effectiveness.

Cons - Bad and pungent smell that lasts quite a while. The knozzel of the bottle is so bad it stops working after a while. So I transfer it to my own spray bottle.

Other then that it's a good and effective product.

Panasonic 23 L Convection Microwave Oven(NN-CT353BFDG,Black Mirror, 360° Heat Wrap, Magic Grill),4.0 out of 5 stars,Recently we had to replace our Sharp Microwave oven that had given us stellar service for over 15 years. After a detailed comparison of products from multiple manufacturers, we decided to opt for the Panasonic 23L Convection Microwave Oven (model number NN-CT353BFDG). The reason we chose this against the others were the following:

1. We wanted a full function microwave around 21L in size. The functions we needed include grilling, reheating, defrosting, cooking, etc.
2. We wanted a microwave that was able to distribute the heat across the food kept inside.
3. Of course, we wanted one that is priced reasonably.

As I said before, after extensive research, we ordered for the Panasonic. It arrived with a few days of our ordering in spite of the pandemic. After about a month or more of use, here are our observations.

1. The Panasonic fits the requirements we had perfectly.
2. It is at a nice price point. Just around 10K.
3. It works well on whatever tasks we have put it to. It grills, heats, and cooks food perfectly.
4. It does not make to much noise, and the beep it sounds upon completion is what we are used to in Sharp.
5. We were used to have a number keyboard in the Sharp. This does not have it. But it takes only a few moments for us to get used to the new controls in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds.
6. The timer and clock are the same button. To set the time you press the button once. To set the clock, you keep the button pressed for a few seconds and you get the 24H display. You can then set the clock.
7. The Panasonic microwave is a little light in weight. We have kept it atop a rubber mat so that it does not move.
8. Panasonic sent it's engineer the same day the product arrived. He was a little disappointed we had already set the microwave up, and had started using it. But he quickly took a deep breath, and explained the features to us. It is a different matter we knew more about the product then he, as we had read the manual thoroughly a few times.
9. The manual is well written and enough for you to understand how to use the microwave.
10. We are, in general, happy with the choice and have started enjoying using the Panasonic Microwave.

The only issue, if at all any, is that since it does not have a number pad, you can set the timer for say, 17 seconds. It has to be in multiple of 10 seconds. But that is manageable.

Misamo Enterprise PVC Wall Hooks, Pack of 15, Transparent,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased another set of these and I still got no negative feedback. It's a good product and it's perfect for people who live on rent. The process of drilling and having hooks can be lengthy, this saves time and money of course.

These hooks have been a lifesaver in my life at least. I've been using these for a few years and I can say it does what it claims. Yet I must say, these won't hold a lot of weight. If you using these for plants then you must know, that they won't hold their weight for months. Maybe some may but all of them won't. It's not the adhesive that is weak but the hook, it comes off with weight. Maybe you can use it for a smaller plant but not a heavier one. Be careful if you are trying with a heavier pot.

This is good for hanging towels, hand towels especially. I use this behind the bathroom door cus it sticks perfectly on doors. I don't know how strongly it will hold on to a wooden door but it sticks best on titles, plastic kinda doors. Yes, it does stick strongly on walls as well but as long as your wall is perfectly finished.

So anyway, to conclude with. It's perfect to hold light weight stuff.

Misamo Enterprise PVC Wall Hooks, Pack of 15, Transparent,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased another set of these and I still got no negative feedback. It's a good product and it's perfect for people who live on rent. The process of drilling and having hooks can be lengthy, this saves time and money of course.

These hooks have been a lifesaver in my life at least. I've been using these for a few years and I can say it does what it claims. Yet I must say, these won't hold a lot of weight. If you using these for plants then you must know, that they won't hold their weight for months. Maybe some may but all of them won't. It's not the adhesive that is weak but the hook, it comes off with weight. Maybe you can use it for a smaller plant but not a heavier one. Be careful if you are trying with a heavier pot.

This is good for hanging towels, hand towels especially. I use this behind the bathroom door cus it sticks perfectly on doors. I don't know how strongly it will hold on to a wooden door but it sticks best on titles, plastic kinda doors. Yes, it does stick strongly on walls as well but as long as your wall is perfectly finished.

So anyway, to conclude with. It's perfect to hold light weight stuff.

rts Universal Travel Adapter, International All in One Worldwide Travel Adapter and Wall Charger with USB Ports with Multi Type Power Outlet USB 2.1A,100-250 Voltage Travel Charger (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Does a great job. I have three of these that I use in Europe and they work great although the 2-pin (foldable) plug is a bit thin and doesn't fit too snuggly in the socket. I also think the folding mechanism feels a bit weak. Still, I've used these in Europe and India for the past 2 years or so. Recommended.

Good knight Gold Flash Liquid Vapourizer | Mosquito Repellent Refill | Lavender Fragrance | Pack of 4 (45ml each),5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Good Knight Gold Flash Vapourizer for months, and it's super effective against mosquitoes. The lavender fragrance is a nice touch, not too overpowering. Plus, the pack of 4 lasts long, making it great value. Highly recommend for a peaceful, mosquito-free home!

The flash feature seems to be more effective when there’s a sudden increase in mosquitoes. I noticed fewer mosquito bites, even when we keep the windows open for a breeze. It kicks in when you need it most, but it’s not constantly on, so it feels like it’s working smarter, not harder.

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,The rechargeable desk lamp is a true gem for anyone looking for a blend of style, functionality, and convenience. The sleek design fits perfectly on any desk, adding a modern touch without taking up too much space.

What really sets it apart is the rechargeable feature—no more hunting for outlets or dealing with tangled cords. The battery life is impressive, lasting through long work sessions or late-night reading. Plus, the adjustable brightness levels cater to every need, whether you want a soft glow or bright light for detailed tasks. I’m fully impressed

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,My bed side reading companion.
Nice product build, light weight with a functional neck hoist, which is easily adjustable and stays at the needed position. The warm light at low illumination can work as a night lamp too. Easy to use touch control. Illumination better when plugged in but battery support is also fairly good.

Tends to topple and needs some weight in the pencil holder part to stay put.

A recent purchase but have used other products from this company and they are good. Hoping this one betters the experience

Reposted this after few months of use and this is going great

Here's why I find this multipurpose spray to be an invaluable asset:

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,I had a couple of Godrej locks whuch got rusted and thus become unusable as they were exposed to rainwater. Though these locks were expensive, I was planning to discard it. Then I decided to take a chance and ordered WD-40. It WORKED beautifully. The locks got loosened, almost miraculously! It does not work immediately after spraying. It does not seem to be a lubricant. I sprayed the locks with WD-40 and left them for 10 hours, and then tried to unlock them, it got UNLICKED, as if new! I recommend it.

This thing of a piece works like magic for me. I had so many scratches on my new car and I was very afraid that I might get those parts repainted. I was literally thought of filing a claim as well for those scratches. The one i have attached in media is the smallest one there were many more worse than this.
I bought this with no expectations and very surprised by the results i got. Almost 80-90% of the scratches were removed completely when rubbed well with a microfiber cloth.
If you have scratches on your car, do not doubt a bit and go ahead with this one.

The spray's prowess extends to effective degreasing. It effortlessly removes grime, grease, and smudges from various surfaces, including wooden tables, countertops, and metallic surfaces of vehicles. This quality makes it a reliable degreasing agent for a variety of applications.

**Active Cleaning Agent:**
WD-40 is not just a lubricant and degreaser; it's also a formidable cleaning agent. It excels at removing stains, dirt, sticky residues, and dust particles. I've witnessed its effectiveness on automobile parts, cleaning spark plugs, and restoring the shine to rusting showpieces.

**Personal Satisfaction:**
My personal experience with WD-40 has been extremely satisfying, particularly in cleaning my vehicle's chain. It brought back the gleam, making it look as good as new. The ease of use and the wide range of applications have made it an indispensable part of my maintenance routine.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, WD-40 has proven to be a game-changer in home and auto care. Its multipurpose functionality, compatibility with various surfaces, and effectiveness in lubrication, degreasing, and cleaning make it an essential tool for DIY enthusiasts and professionals alike. I highly recommend WD-40 for anyone seeking a reliable, all-in-one solution for their maintenance needs.

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,I had a couple of Godrej locks whuch got rusted and thus become unusable as they were exposed to rainwater. Though these locks were expensive, I was planning to discard it. Then I decided to take a chance and ordered WD-40. It WORKED beautifully. The locks got loosened, almost miraculously! It does not work immediately after spraying. It does not seem to be a lubricant. I sprayed the locks with WD-40 and left them for 10 hours, and then tried to unlock them, it got UNLICKED, as if new! I recommend it.

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,You can not miss this to have it if you own a car. This thing of a piece works like magic for me. I had so many scratches on my new car and I was very afraid that I might get those parts repainted. I was literally thought of filing a claim as well for those scratches. The one i have attached in media is the smallest one there were many more worse than this.
I bought this with no expectations and very surprised by the results i got. Almost 80-90% of the scratches were removed completely when rubbed well with a microfiber cloth.
If you have scratches on your car, do not doubt a bit and go ahead with this one.

I recently purchased bamboo tissues, and I am thoroughly impressed with their quality. Unlike regular paper tissues, these bamboo tissues are incredibly soft and durable. One of the standout features is that a single tissue lasts much longer, reducing waste significantly. This makes them not only a more sustainable choice but also a cost-effective one. I highly recommend these bamboo tissues for anyone looking for a soft, eco-friendly alternative to paper tissues.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,4.0 out of 5 stars,To start, this product's packaging is minimal and crafted from recycled materials, showcasing the company's dedication to sustainability. The tissues themselves are created from 100% natural bamboo, a highly renewable resource that is more environmentally conscious than traditional wood pulp.

Upon my initial use of the tissues, I was pleasantly surprised by their softness and gentle touch on my skin. Often, eco-friendly products can be abrasive and rough, but these tissues are luxuriously soft. Moreover, they possess a 2-ply design, making them sturdy and long-lasting. In the past, I have used other environmentally friendly tissues that easily tore or disintegrated, but these hold up well and leave no residue.

I am also thrilled that this pack contains 100 pulls per box, eliminating the need for frequent restocking. Furthermore, with a pack of 6, I have an ample supply of tissues to last me a considerable amount of time.

What I appreciate most about these tissues is that they are not only beneficial to the environment, but they are also beneficial to my skin. As someone with sensitive skin, I often react to harsh chemicals and fragrances, but these tissues contain no harmful additives.

Overall, I highly recommend the Beco Bamboo Super Soft Facial Tissue for anyone seeking a sustainable and gentle solution for their facial tissue needs. It is a small change that can have a significant impact on the environment, and it is a product that I will continue to purchase in the future.

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),5.0 out of 5 stars,** First Impression **
● The shuttle is yellow in colour with green band at the base. The shuttle base is cork with nylon covering and the skirts are also nylon
● This comes in a carton tube with 6 shuttles packed. The carton has holograms
● The shuttles are manufactured in Japan and is imported by Sunrise Sports

** Product Verification **
● A lot of reviews here say that they think they have got a counterfeit product. You can verify your purchase at Yonex website using the serial number
● The serial number can be revealed by scratching the hologram label. Goto the website 'sunrisetnt' and enter this code there; it's case-sensitive. The site will tell you whether your purchase is genuine or not

** Performance **
● I am an amateur and play on outdoor clay court
● I play with green cap, which is slower in comparison with other caps. However after one or two games, the difference in behaviour disappears
● The recovery of shuttle after the shot is very fast and a problem with this has never been experienced or noted during the play
● The performance in flight path is also not something that gets noticed or influencing while playing badminton as an amateur
● I have been mostly using 350 and a shuttle lasts for around 10 to 15 games before it starts showing signs of disintegration. I replace the shuttle when the first crack appears on the skirt

** Major Differences between popular Shuttlecocks **
● Mavis 10
- Mavis 10 has a nylon base, other shuttles compared here have cork base. So, this lasts longer and best suited for practise sessions
- The flight performance has the least resemblance to feather shuttles. So if you practise for tournaments, I suggest not to use this. If you are a beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is a good choice
● Mavis 300 & 350
- Both these have cork base and nylon feathers
- These shuttles are a tad slower than Mavis 10 and behaviour is closer to feather shuttles in performance when compared with 10
- If you are an amateur who is serious about badminton, this is the best shuttles for you to purchase
- Most of the badminton trainers and coaching centers use either 300 or 350
- I could not experience any difference between 300 and 350, but many people think 350 is better in terms of flight path and durability and my choice of shuttles are 350
● Mavis 500
- This has got cork base and nylon feathers
- These are closer to feather shuttles in terms of flight behaviour & feel than 300/350 and the rate at which it slows down is faster. These shuttles provide more precision & control, and obviously are costlier
- Having said all these, you may not be able to spot much difference even if you are an advanced amateur. However, I have observed that the skirt starts cracking quicker than 350
● Mavis 2000
- This has got the best flight behaviour of all the above and is mostly used for tournaments if feather shuttle is not used. These shuttles are light and the speed & sturdiness are the closest to feather shuttles
● Feather Shuttles
- Nylon shuttlecocks can never match the flight behaviour of feather shuttles. If you want to gain clear control, feel, touch and master different strokes, you have to play on feather shuttles
- One of the major differences in behaviour with nylon shuttles is the dramatic slowing down of feather shuttles. Professionals and serious badminton players use feather shuttles that helps them gain superior techniques and precision control
● Cap Colour
- The colours on cap indicate the speed of the shuttle. When the climate is hot, the air resistance will be less thus making the shuttle travel faster than in cold conditions. This is compensated by using slower shuttles in hot conditions and faster shuttles in cold conditions
- Green cap is the slowest shuttle. You have to put in more power to push the shuttle to the back of the court. This is more suitable for hot and humid weather or at high altitudes
- Blue cap shuttles have medium speed and is most suited for areas where temperature is around 20 degrees
- Red is the fastest of the three and is best for temperatures around 10 degrees and at low altitudes where the air is denser
- I live in Kerala and I normally pick the green cap
● Shuttle Colour
- Colour of shuttle does not have any significance. Yellow shuttles have got more visibility over the white ones

** Summary **
● All these shuttles look almost the same. The main physical difference you can see is the size of holes in the mesh on the shuttle skirt. There are other differences in the cap material, weight of the cap, etc. that determines the behaviour of the shuttle
● If you are an amateur beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is enough which is cheaper and have the most life
● 300 or 350 is best suited if you are amateur but a serious gamer. I don't really know the difference between 300 and 350, but many people say 350 is a better one
● 500 is recommended if you want to experience shuttle behaviour closer to feathers as an amateur
● 2000 is recommended for aspiring professionals incase you don't have the luxury to practise with feathers
● Having said all these, I have to disclaim that this is from my own experience of playing the game and other players I have spoken with have different opinions, especially on the difference between 300, 350 and 500.

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),5.0 out of 5 stars,** First Impression **
● The shuttle is yellow in colour with green band at the base. The shuttle base is cork with nylon covering and the skirts are also nylon
● This comes in a carton tube with 6 shuttles packed. The carton has holograms
● The shuttles are manufactured in Japan and is imported by Sunrise Sports

** Product Verification **
● A lot of reviews here say that they think they have got a counterfeit product. You can verify your purchase at Yonex website using the serial number
● The serial number can be revealed by scratching the hologram label. Goto the website 'sunrisetnt' and enter this code there; it's case-sensitive. The site will tell you whether your purchase is genuine or not

** Performance **
● I am an amateur and play on outdoor clay court
● I play with green cap, which is slower in comparison with other caps. However after one or two games, the difference in behaviour disappears
● The recovery of shuttle after the shot is very fast and a problem with this has never been experienced or noted during the play
● The performance in flight path is also not something that gets noticed or influencing while playing badminton as an amateur
● I have been mostly using 350 and a shuttle lasts for around 10 to 15 games before it starts showing signs of disintegration. I replace the shuttle when the first crack appears on the skirt

** Major Differences between popular Shuttlecocks **
● Mavis 10
- Mavis 10 has a nylon base, other shuttles compared here have cork base. So, this lasts longer and best suited for practise sessions
- The flight performance has the least resemblance to feather shuttles. So if you practise for tournaments, I suggest not to use this. If you are a beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is a good choice
● Mavis 300 & 350
- Both these have cork base and nylon feathers
- These shuttles are a tad slower than Mavis 10 and behaviour is closer to feather shuttles in performance when compared with 10
- If you are an amateur who is serious about badminton, this is the best shuttles for you to purchase
- Most of the badminton trainers and coaching centers use either 300 or 350
- I could not experience any difference between 300 and 350, but many people think 350 is better in terms of flight path and durability and my choice of shuttles are 350
● Mavis 500
- This has got cork base and nylon feathers
- These are closer to feather shuttles in terms of flight behaviour & feel than 300/350 and the rate at which it slows down is faster. These shuttles provide more precision & control, and obviously are costlier
- Having said all these, you may not be able to spot much difference even if you are an advanced amateur. However, I have observed that the skirt starts cracking quicker than 350
● Mavis 2000
- This has got the best flight behaviour of all the above and is mostly used for tournaments if feather shuttle is not used. These shuttles are light and the speed & sturdiness are the closest to feather shuttles
● Feather Shuttles
- Nylon shuttlecocks can never match the flight behaviour of feather shuttles. If you want to gain clear control, feel, touch and master different strokes, you have to play on feather shuttles
- One of the major differences in behaviour with nylon shuttles is the dramatic slowing down of feather shuttles. Professionals and serious badminton players use feather shuttles that helps them gain superior techniques and precision control
● Cap Colour
- The colours on cap indicate the speed of the shuttle. When the climate is hot, the air resistance will be less thus making the shuttle travel faster than in cold conditions. This is compensated by using slower shuttles in hot conditions and faster shuttles in cold conditions
- Green cap is the slowest shuttle. You have to put in more power to push the shuttle to the back of the court. This is more suitable for hot and humid weather or at high altitudes
- Blue cap shuttles have medium speed and is most suited for areas where temperature is around 20 degrees
- Red is the fastest of the three and is best for temperatures around 10 degrees and at low altitudes where the air is denser
- I live in Kerala and I normally pick the green cap
● Shuttle Colour
- Colour of shuttle does not have any significance. Yellow shuttles have got more visibility over the white ones

** Summary **
● All these shuttles look almost the same. The main physical difference you can see is the size of holes in the mesh on the shuttle skirt. There are other differences in the cap material, weight of the cap, etc. that determines the behaviour of the shuttle
● If you are an amateur beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is enough which is cheaper and have the most life
● 300 or 350 is best suited if you are amateur but a serious gamer. I don't really know the difference between 300 and 350, but many people say 350 is a better one
● 500 is recommended if you want to experience shuttle behaviour closer to feathers as an amateur
● 2000 is recommended for aspiring professionals incase you don't have the luxury to practise with feathers
● Having said all these, I have to disclaim that this is from my own experience of playing the game and other players I have spoken with have different opinions, especially on the difference between 300, 350 and 500.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic, and my experience has been somewhat mixed.

First, the positives: The scale is indeed portable and compact, making it easy to store in my kitchen drawer without taking up too much space. It's lightweight, which adds to its portability, and the design is sleek and modern, which fits well with my kitchen decor. The digital display is clear and easy to read, and the scale is user-friendly with simple controls.

However, there are several drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. The accuracy of the scale is quite disappointing, with a margin of error of about ±3 grams. For precise measurements, especially in baking or other culinary activities where accuracy is crucial, this can be quite problematic. I found myself needing to double-check measurements with another scale to ensure accuracy.

Additionally, the material quality leaves much to be desired. The scale is made of low-quality plastic, which feels flimsy and not particularly durable. I'm concerned about its longevity, especially with regular use in a busy kitchen environment. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will last very long without developing cracks or other signs of wear and tear.

In summary, while the beatXP Kitchen Scale has some convenient features and an attractive design, its lack of accuracy and low-quality materials are significant downsides. If precision and durability are important to you, you might want to consider other options on the market.

VOLTURI Fridge Storage Boxes (Pack of 6), Fridge Organisers with Removable Drain Plate, Fridge Storage Containers Keeps Fruits, Vegetables, Pantry Items Stackable, Space-Saving Storage Box Set, 1.5L,4.0 out of 5 stars,Liked the product. Could be more happy if the depth of the containers r little deeper, especially for vegetables as we used for. Other thing is covers r can't be closed easily, it needs attention to do so and even gets loose subsequently. Otherwise material seems not bad. Size options or assorted size may help people to choose as per their requirement.

The simplicity of operation is another standout feature. With just a push of a button, I can select my desired level of doneness and let the egg boiler work its magic. No more hovering over a pot of boiling water, hoping for consistent results. This device takes the guesswork out of egg cooking, which is a game-changer for busy mornings.

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a good product. Before this gas stove was used in my home. Near about 20 minutes of waste LPG gas for boilling the egg. But, this product takes only 5> to <10 minutes to boil the 7 eggs together.
But, this has 3 draw back.
1) After autoshut the boiler. If I forget to switch off the plug, after some times the boiler gets auto on.
2) Unable to make half-boil eggs with this product, even folloing the instruction to the letter.
3) Unable to crack the top of the eggs as instructed. Egg shell is very tough, it's not easy to drill. So much force and the eggs will shattered.

JIALTO Adhesive Hooks Heavy Duty Wall Hooks, Nail Hook for Hanging Coat, Hat,Towel Robe Hook Rack Wall Mount- Bathroom and Bedroom Hooks for Wall Without Drilling (Nail Hook Trasparent 10 Pack),4.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality. But price is high for such products where these types of products actually made of interest Rs 1.00 /- even we include all the travel, package, promotion, retail margin etc etc...that should be Rs. 4 - Rs 5 /- per peace or even less.

Price is a big Factor. Otherwise product is good.

Pidilite Terminator Eco-Friendly Termite Killer Spray| Wood Preservative and Termite, Borer, Insect Repellant Spray| For Home, Kitchen and Offices (1 Ltr),4.0 out of 5 stars,This is like a life saver. Our rented flat has termites in the wood and cabinets. The landlord though did get it treated but it comes back. It's an year now that I am using it . It is very effective. You can see the effectiveness with once spray and the termites lay dead. But you need to spray periodically to maintain it effectiveness.

Cons - Bad and pungent smell that lasts quite a while. The knozzel of the bottle is so bad it stops working after a while. So I transfer it to my own spray bottle.

Other then that it's a good and effective product.

Pidilite Terminator Eco-Friendly Termite Killer Spray| Wood Preservative and Termite, Borer, Insect Repellant Spray| For Home, Kitchen and Offices (1 Ltr),1.0 out of 5 stars,The quality of container is pathetic and not at all done to any standard. The co. hasn't taken any notice that it's a product that is otherwise very unsafe. Even when the container is closed, it continues to emit the smell. I am completely surprised and shocked that this product has been cleared by the quality function at Pidilite which otherwise takes a lot of pride about the quality they offer. Also, no safety instructions are provided other than related to storage.

Panasonic 23 L Convection Microwave Oven(NN-CT353BFDG,Black Mirror, 360° Heat Wrap, Magic Grill),4.0 out of 5 stars,Recently we had to replace our Sharp Microwave oven that had given us stellar service for over 15 years. After a detailed comparison of products from multiple manufacturers, we decided to opt for the Panasonic 23L Convection Microwave Oven (model number NN-CT353BFDG). The reason we chose this against the others were the following:

1. We wanted a full function microwave around 21L in size. The functions we needed include grilling, reheating, defrosting, cooking, etc.
2. We wanted a microwave that was able to distribute the heat across the food kept inside.
3. Of course, we wanted one that is priced reasonably.

As I said before, after extensive research, we ordered for the Panasonic. It arrived with a few days of our ordering in spite of the pandemic. After about a month or more of use, here are our observations.

1. The Panasonic fits the requirements we had perfectly.
2. It is at a nice price point. Just around 10K.
3. It works well on whatever tasks we have put it to. It grills, heats, and cooks food perfectly.
4. It does not make to much noise, and the beep it sounds upon completion is what we are used to in Sharp.
5. We were used to have a number keyboard in the Sharp. This does not have it. But it takes only a few moments for us to get used to the new controls in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds.
6. The timer and clock are the same button. To set the time you press the button once. To set the clock, you keep the button pressed for a few seconds and you get the 24H display. You can then set the clock.
7. The Panasonic microwave is a little light in weight. We have kept it atop a rubber mat so that it does not move.
8. Panasonic sent it's engineer the same day the product arrived. He was a little disappointed we had already set the microwave up, and had started using it. But he quickly took a deep breath, and explained the features to us. It is a different matter we knew more about the product then he, as we had read the manual thoroughly a few times.
9. The manual is well written and enough for you to understand how to use the microwave.
10. We are, in general, happy with the choice and have started enjoying using the Panasonic Microwave.

The only issue, if at all any, is that since it does not have a number pad, you can set the timer for say, 17 seconds. It has to be in multiple of 10 seconds. But that is manageable.

Misamo Enterprise PVC Wall Hooks, Pack of 15, Transparent,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased another set of these and I still got no negative feedback. It's a good product and it's perfect for people who live on rent. The process of drilling and having hooks can be lengthy, this saves time and money of course.

These hooks have been a lifesaver in my life at least. I've been using these for a few years and I can say it does what it claims. Yet I must say, these won't hold a lot of weight. If you using these for plants then you must know, that they won't hold their weight for months. Maybe some may but all of them won't. It's not the adhesive that is weak but the hook, it comes off with weight. Maybe you can use it for a smaller plant but not a heavier one. Be careful if you are trying with a heavier pot.

This is good for hanging towels, hand towels especially. I use this behind the bathroom door cus it sticks perfectly on doors. I don't know how strongly it will hold on to a wooden door but it sticks best on titles, plastic kinda doors. Yes, it does stick strongly on walls as well but as long as your wall is perfectly finished.

So anyway, to conclude with. It's perfect to hold light weight stuff.

rts Universal Travel Adapter, International All in One Worldwide Travel Adapter and Wall Charger with USB Ports with Multi Type Power Outlet USB 2.1A,100-250 Voltage Travel Charger (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Does a great job. I have three of these that I use in Europe and they work great although the 2-pin (foldable) plug is a bit thin and doesn't fit too snuggly in the socket. I also think the folding mechanism feels a bit weak. Still, I've used these in Europe and India for the past 2 years or so. Recommended.

This adapter exceeded my expectations. It looks great, is durable, and fits properly. I highly recommend it!

Good knight Gold Flash Liquid Vapourizer | Mosquito Repellent Refill | Lavender Fragrance | Pack of 4 (45ml each),5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Good Knight Gold Flash Vapourizer for months, and it's super effective against mosquitoes. The lavender fragrance is a nice touch, not too overpowering. Plus, the pack of 4 lasts long, making it great value. Highly recommend for a peaceful, mosquito-free home!

The flash feature seems to be more effective when there’s a sudden increase in mosquitoes. I noticed fewer mosquito bites, even when we keep the windows open for a breeze. It kicks in when you need it most, but it’s not constantly on, so it feels like it’s working smarter, not harder.

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,The rechargeable desk lamp is a true gem for anyone looking for a blend of style, functionality, and convenience. The sleek design fits perfectly on any desk, adding a modern touch without taking up too much space.

What really sets it apart is the rechargeable feature—no more hunting for outlets or dealing with tangled cords. The battery life is impressive, lasting through long work sessions or late-night reading. Plus, the adjustable brightness levels cater to every need, whether you want a soft glow or bright light for detailed tasks. I’m fully impressed

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,My bed side reading companion.
Nice product build, light weight with a functional neck hoist, which is easily adjustable and stays at the needed position. The warm light at low illumination can work as a night lamp too. Easy to use touch control. Illumination better when plugged in but battery support is also fairly good.

Tends to topple and needs some weight in the pencil holder part to stay put.

A recent purchase but have used other products from this company and they are good. Hoping this one betters the experience

It does not work immediately after spraying. It does not seem to be a lubricant. I sprayed the locks with WD-40 and left them for 10 hours, and then tried to unlock them, it got UNLICKED, as if new!

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,5.0 out of 5 stars,That sounds like a great product! I recently purchased bamboo tissues, and I am thoroughly impressed with their quality. Unlike regular paper tissues, these bamboo tissues are incredibly soft and durable. One of the standout features is that a single tissue lasts much longer, reducing waste significantly. This makes them not only a more sustainable choice but also a cost-effective one. I highly recommend these bamboo tissues for anyone looking for a soft, eco-friendly alternative to paper tissues.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,4.0 out of 5 stars,To start, this product's packaging is minimal and crafted from recycled materials, showcasing the company's dedication to sustainability. The tissues themselves are created from 100% natural bamboo, a highly renewable resource that is more environmentally conscious than traditional wood pulp.

Upon my initial use of the tissues, I was pleasantly surprised by their softness and gentle touch on my skin. Often, eco-friendly products can be abrasive and rough, but these tissues are luxuriously soft. Moreover, they possess a 2-ply design, making them sturdy and long-lasting. In the past, I have used other environmentally friendly tissues that easily tore or disintegrated, but these hold up well and leave no residue.

I am also thrilled that this pack contains 100 pulls per box, eliminating the need for frequent restocking. Furthermore, with a pack of 6, I have an ample supply of tissues to last me a considerable amount of time.

What I appreciate most about these tissues is that they are not only beneficial to the environment, but they are also beneficial to my skin. As someone with sensitive skin, I often react to harsh chemicals and fragrances, but these tissues contain no harmful additives.

Overall, I highly recommend the Beco Bamboo Super Soft Facial Tissue for anyone seeking a sustainable and gentle solution for their facial tissue needs. It is a small change that can have a significant impact on the environment, and it is a product that I will continue to purchase in the future.

● The shuttles are manufactured in Japan and is imported by Sunrise Sports

** Product Verification **
● A lot of reviews here say that they think they have got a counterfeit product. You can verify your purchase at Yonex website using the serial number
● The serial number can be revealed by scratching the hologram label. Goto the website 'sunrisetnt' and enter this code there; it's case-sensitive. The site will tell you whether your purchase is genuine or not

** Performance **
● I am an amateur and play on outdoor clay court
● I play with green cap, which is slower in comparison with other caps. However after one or two games, the difference in behaviour disappears
● The recovery of shuttle after the shot is very fast and a problem with this has never been experienced or noted during the play
● The performance in flight path is also not something that gets noticed or influencing while playing badminton as an amateur
● I have been mostly using 350 and a shuttle lasts for around 10 to 15 games before it starts showing signs of disintegration. I replace the shuttle when the first crack appears on the skirt

** Major Differences between popular Shuttlecocks **
● Mavis 10
- Mavis 10 has a nylon base, other shuttles compared here have cork base. So, this lasts longer and best suited for practise sessions
- The flight performance has the least resemblance to feather shuttles. So if you practise for tournaments, I suggest not to use this. If you are a beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is a good choice
● Mavis 300 & 350
- Both these have cork base and nylon feathers
- These shuttles are a tad slower than Mavis 10 and behaviour is closer to feather shuttles in performance when compared with 10
- If you are an amateur who is serious about badminton, this is the best shuttles for you to purchase
- Most of the badminton trainers and coaching centers use either 300 or 350
- I could not experience any difference between 300 and 350, but many people think 350 is better in terms of flight path and durability and my choice of shuttles are 350
● Mavis 500
- This has got cork base and nylon feathers
- These are closer to feather shuttles in terms of flight behaviour & feel than 300/350 and the rate at which it slows down is faster. These shuttles provide more precision & control, and obviously are costlier
- Having said all these, you may not be able to spot much difference even if you are an advanced amateur. However, I have observed that the skirt starts cracking quicker than 350
● Mavis 2000
- This has got the best flight behaviour of all the above and is mostly used for tournaments if feather shuttle is not used. These shuttles are light and the speed & sturdiness are the closest to feather shuttles
● Feather Shuttles
- Nylon shuttlecocks can never match the flight behaviour of feather shuttles. If you want to gain clear control, feel, touch and master different strokes, you have to play on feather shuttles
- One of the major differences in behaviour with nylon shuttles is the dramatic slowing down of feather shuttles. Professionals and serious badminton players use feather shuttles that helps them gain superior techniques and precision control
● Cap Colour
- The colours on cap indicate the speed of the shuttle. When the climate is hot, the air resistance will be less thus making the shuttle travel faster than in cold conditions. This is compensated by using slower shuttles in hot conditions and faster shuttles in cold conditions
- Green cap is the slowest shuttle. You have to put in more power to push the shuttle to the back of the court. This is more suitable for hot and humid weather or at high altitudes
- Blue cap shuttles have medium speed and is most suited for areas where temperature is around 20 degrees
- Red is the fastest of the three and is best for temperatures around 10 degrees and at low altitudes where the air is denser
- I live in Kerala and I normally pick the green cap
● Shuttle Colour
- Colour of shuttle does not have any significance. Yellow shuttles have got more visibility over the white ones

** Summary **
● All these shuttles look almost the same. The main physical difference you can see is the size of holes in the mesh on the shuttle skirt. There are other differences in the cap material, weight of the cap, etc. that determines the behaviour of the shuttle
● If you are an amateur beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is enough which is cheaper and have the most life
● 300 or 350 is best suited if you are amateur but a serious gamer. I don't really know the difference between 300 and 350, but many people say 350 is a better one
● 500 is recommended if you want to experience shuttle behaviour closer to feathers as an amateur
● 2000 is recommended for aspiring professionals incase you don't have the luxury to practise with feathers
● Having said all these, I have to disclaim that this is from my own experience of playing the game and other players I have spoken with have different opinions, especially on the difference between 300, 350 and 500.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic, and my experience has been somewhat mixed.

First, the positives: The scale is indeed portable and compact, making it easy to store in my kitchen drawer without taking up too much space. It's lightweight, which adds to its portability, and the design is sleek and modern, which fits well with my kitchen decor. The digital display is clear and easy to read, and the scale is user-friendly with simple controls.

However, there are several drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. The accuracy of the scale is quite disappointing, with a margin of error of about ±3 grams. For precise measurements, especially in baking or other culinary activities where accuracy is crucial, this can be quite problematic. I found myself needing to double-check measurements with another scale to ensure accuracy.

Additionally, the material quality leaves much to be desired. The scale is made of low-quality plastic, which feels flimsy and not particularly durable. I'm concerned about its longevity, especially with regular use in a busy kitchen environment. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will last very long without developing cracks or other signs of wear and tear.

In summary, while the beatXP Kitchen Scale has some convenient features and an attractive design, its lack of accuracy and low-quality materials are significant downsides. If precision and durability are important to you, you might want to consider other options on the market.

It's a basic kitchen scale that does the job, but it doesn't exceed expectations. The scale offers decent accuracy and is easy to use, making it a practical choice for those on a budget. However, the build quality and features are quite basic, which is understandable given its low cost.

If you're looking for something that just works without any bells and whistles, this scale fits the bill. But if you require more precision or durability, you might want to consider investing in a higher-end model. Overall, it's an okay product that delivers fair value for its cost.

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a good product. Before this gas stove was used in my home. Near about 20 minutes of waste LPG gas for boilling the egg. But, this product takes only 5> to <10 minutes to boil the 7 eggs together.
But, this has 3 draw back.
1) After autoshut the boiler. If I forget to switch off the plug, after some times the boiler gets auto on.
2) Unable to make half-boil eggs with this product, even folloing the instruction to the letter.
3) Unable to crack the top of the eggs as instructed. Egg shell is very tough, it's not easy to drill. So much force and the eggs will shattered.

I cannot express how thrilled I am with my recent purchase of the Amazon basics Egg Boiler! This little appliance has truly transformed my mornings and simplified my meal prep routine.

The simplicity of operation is another standout feature. With just a push of a button, I can select my desired level of doneness and let the egg boiler work its magic. No more hovering over a pot of boiling water, hoping for consistent results. This device takes the guesswork out of egg cooking, which is a game-changer for busy mornings.

Clean-up is a breeze with the removable parts being dishwasher-safe, saving me precious time and effort. The compact design also makes storage a non-issue, fitting perfectly in my kitchen cabinet without taking up too much space.

Additionally, I appreciate the thoughtful design elements incorporated into this egg boiler. The automatic shut-off feature ensures safety and prevents overcooking, giving me peace of mind while multitasking in the kitchen.

Overall, the Amazon basics Egg Boiler has exceeded my expectations in every aspect. It's reliable, efficient, and incredibly easy to use.

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a good product. Before this gas stove was used in my home. Near about 20 minutes of waste LPG gas for boilling the egg. But, this product takes only 5> to <10 minutes to boil the 7 eggs together.
But, this has 3 draw back.
1) After autoshut the boiler. If I forget to switch off the plug, after some times the boiler gets auto on.
2) Unable to make half-boil eggs with this product, even folloing the instruction to the letter.
3) Unable to crack the top of the eggs as instructed. Egg shell is very tough, it's not easy to drill. So much force and the eggs will shattered.

Pidilite Terminator Eco-Friendly Termite Killer Spray| Wood Preservative and Termite, Borer, Insect Repellant Spray| For Home, Kitchen and Offices (1 Ltr),4.0 out of 5 stars,This is like a life saver. Our rented flat has termites in the wood and cabinets. The landlord though did get it treated but it comes back. It's an year now that I am using it . It is very effective. You can see the effectiveness with once spray and the termites lay dead. But you need to spray periodically to maintain it effectiveness.

Cons - Bad and pungent smell that lasts quite a while. The knozzel of the bottle is so bad it stops working after a while. So I transfer it to my own spray bottle.

Other then that it's a good and effective product.

Panasonic 23 L Convection Microwave Oven(NN-CT353BFDG,Black Mirror, 360° Heat Wrap, Magic Grill),4.0 out of 5 stars,Recently we had to replace our Sharp Microwave oven that had given us stellar service for over 15 years. After a detailed comparison of products from multiple manufacturers, we decided to opt for the Panasonic 23L Convection Microwave Oven (model number NN-CT353BFDG). The reason we chose this against the others were the following:

1. We wanted a full function microwave around 21L in size. The functions we needed include grilling, reheating, defrosting, cooking, etc.
2. We wanted a microwave that was able to distribute the heat across the food kept inside.
3. Of course, we wanted one that is priced reasonably.

As I said before, after extensive research, we ordered for the Panasonic. It arrived with a few days of our ordering in spite of the pandemic. After about a month or more of use, here are our observations.

1. The Panasonic fits the requirements we had perfectly.
2. It is at a nice price point. Just around 10K.
3. It works well on whatever tasks we have put it to. It grills, heats, and cooks food perfectly.
4. It does not make to much noise, and the beep it sounds upon completion is what we are used to in Sharp.
5. We were used to have a number keyboard in the Sharp. This does not have it. But it takes only a few moments for us to get used to the new controls in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds.
6. The timer and clock are the same button. To set the time you press the button once. To set the clock, you keep the button pressed for a few seconds and you get the 24H display. You can then set the clock.
7. The Panasonic microwave is a little light in weight. We have kept it atop a rubber mat so that it does not move.
8. Panasonic sent it's engineer the same day the product arrived. He was a little disappointed we had already set the microwave up, and had started using it. But he quickly took a deep breath, and explained the features to us. It is a different matter we knew more about the product then he, as we had read the manual thoroughly a few times.
9. The manual is well written and enough for you to understand how to use the microwave.
10. We are, in general, happy with the choice and have started enjoying using the Panasonic Microwave.

The only issue, if at all any, is that since it does not have a number pad, you can set the timer for say, 17 seconds. It has to be in multiple of 10 seconds. But that is manageable.

Misamo Enterprise PVC Wall Hooks, Pack of 15, Transparent,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased another set of these and I still got no negative feedback. It's a good product and it's perfect for people who live on rent. The process of drilling and having hooks can be lengthy, this saves time and money of course.

These hooks have been a lifesaver in my life at least. I've been using these for a few years and I can say it does what it claims. Yet I must say, these won't hold a lot of weight. If you using these for plants then you must know, that they won't hold their weight for months. Maybe some may but all of them won't. It's not the adhesive that is weak but the hook, it comes off with weight. Maybe you can use it for a smaller plant but not a heavier one. Be careful if you are trying with a heavier pot.

This is good for hanging towels, hand towels especially. I use this behind the bathroom door cus it sticks perfectly on doors. I don't know how strongly it will hold on to a wooden door but it sticks best on titles, plastic kinda doors. Yes, it does stick strongly on walls as well but as long as your wall is perfectly finished.

So anyway, to conclude with. It's perfect to hold light weight stuff.

rts Universal Travel Adapter, International All in One Worldwide Travel Adapter and Wall Charger with USB Ports with Multi Type Power Outlet USB 2.1A,100-250 Voltage Travel Charger (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Does a great job. I have three of these that I use in Europe and they work great although the 2-pin (foldable) plug is a bit thin and doesn't fit too snuggly in the socket. I also think the folding mechanism feels a bit weak. Still, I've used these in Europe and India for the past 2 years or so. Recommended.

This adapter exceeded my expectations. It looks great, is durable, and fits properly. I highly recommend it!

Very handy to carry along. Used in Singapore and Cambodia. Very useful - particularly in Singapore (hotels in Cambodia had multi-adapter sockets). Nice colour too. Only difficulty faced - one of the standalone pins (of a 3 pin plug) was difficult to take out. Hence not given 5 star.

Good knight Gold Flash Liquid Vapourizer | Mosquito Repellent Refill | Lavender Fragrance | Pack of 4 (45ml each),5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Good Knight Gold Flash Vapourizer for months, and it's super effective against mosquitoes. The lavender fragrance is a nice touch, not too overpowering. Plus, the pack of 4 lasts long, making it great value. Highly recommend for a peaceful, mosquito-free home!

The flash feature seems to be more effective when there’s a sudden increase in mosquitoes. I noticed fewer mosquito bites, even when we keep the windows open for a breeze. It kicks in when you need it most, but it’s not constantly on, so it feels like it’s working smarter, not harder.

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,The rechargeable desk lamp is a true gem for anyone looking for a blend of style, functionality, and convenience. The sleek design fits perfectly on any desk, adding a modern touch without taking up too much space.

What really sets it apart is the rechargeable feature—no more hunting for outlets or dealing with tangled cords. The battery life is impressive, lasting through long work sessions or late-night reading. Plus, the adjustable brightness levels cater to every need, whether you want a soft glow or bright light for detailed tasks. I’m fully impressed

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,My bed side reading companion.
Nice product build, light weight with a functional neck hoist, which is easily adjustable and stays at the needed position. The warm light at low illumination can work as a night lamp too. Easy to use touch control. Illumination better when plugged in but battery support is also fairly good.

Tends to topple and needs some weight in the pencil holder part to stay put.

A recent purchase but have used other products from this company and they are good. Hoping this one betters the experience

It does not work immediately after spraying. It does not seem to be a lubricant. I sprayed the locks with WD-40 and left them for 10 hours, and then tried to unlock them, it got UNLICKED, as if new!

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,5.0 out of 5 stars,That sounds like a great product! I recently purchased bamboo tissues, and I am thoroughly impressed with their quality. Unlike regular paper tissues, these bamboo tissues are incredibly soft and durable. One of the standout features is that a single tissue lasts much longer, reducing waste significantly. This makes them not only a more sustainable choice but also a cost-effective one. I highly recommend these bamboo tissues for anyone looking for a soft, eco-friendly alternative to paper tissues.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,4.0 out of 5 stars,To start, this product's packaging is minimal and crafted from recycled materials, showcasing the company's dedication to sustainability. The tissues themselves are created from 100% natural bamboo, a highly renewable resource that is more environmentally conscious than traditional wood pulp.

Upon my initial use of the tissues, I was pleasantly surprised by their softness and gentle touch on my skin. Often, eco-friendly products can be abrasive and rough, but these tissues are luxuriously soft. Moreover, they possess a 2-ply design, making them sturdy and long-lasting. In the past, I have used other environmentally friendly tissues that easily tore or disintegrated, but these hold up well and leave no residue.

I am also thrilled that this pack contains 100 pulls per box, eliminating the need for frequent restocking. Furthermore, with a pack of 6, I have an ample supply of tissues to last me a considerable amount of time.

What I appreciate most about these tissues is that they are not only beneficial to the environment, but they are also beneficial to my skin. As someone with sensitive skin, I often react to harsh chemicals and fragrances, but these tissues contain no harmful additives.

Overall, I highly recommend the Beco Bamboo Super Soft Facial Tissue for anyone seeking a sustainable and gentle solution for their facial tissue needs. It is a small change that can have a significant impact on the environment, and it is a product that I will continue to purchase in the future.

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),5.0 out of 5 stars,** First Impression **
● The shuttle is yellow in colour with green band at the base. The shuttle base is cork with nylon covering and the skirts are also nylon
● This comes in a carton tube with 6 shuttles packed. The carton has holograms
● The shuttles are manufactured in Japan and is imported by Sunrise Sports

** Product Verification **
● A lot of reviews here say that they think they have got a counterfeit product. You can verify your purchase at Yonex website using the serial number
● The serial number can be revealed by scratching the hologram label. Goto the website 'sunrisetnt' and enter this code there; it's case-sensitive. The site will tell you whether your purchase is genuine or not

** Performance **
● I am an amateur and play on outdoor clay court
● I play with green cap, which is slower in comparison with other caps. However after one or two games, the difference in behaviour disappears
● The recovery of shuttle after the shot is very fast and a problem with this has never been experienced or noted during the play
● The performance in flight path is also not something that gets noticed or influencing while playing badminton as an amateur
● I have been mostly using 350 and a shuttle lasts for around 10 to 15 games before it starts showing signs of disintegration. I replace the shuttle when the first crack appears on the skirt

** Major Differences between popular Shuttlecocks **
● Mavis 10
- Mavis 10 has a nylon base, other shuttles compared here have cork base. So, this lasts longer and best suited for practise sessions
- The flight performance has the least resemblance to feather shuttles. So if you practise for tournaments, I suggest not to use this. If you are a beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is a good choice
● Mavis 300 & 350
- Both these have cork base and nylon feathers
- These shuttles are a tad slower than Mavis 10 and behaviour is closer to feather shuttles in performance when compared with 10
- If you are an amateur who is serious about badminton, this is the best shuttles for you to purchase
- Most of the badminton trainers and coaching centers use either 300 or 350
- I could not experience any difference between 300 and 350, but many people think 350 is better in terms of flight path and durability and my choice of shuttles are 350
● Mavis 500
- This has got cork base and nylon feathers
- These are closer to feather shuttles in terms of flight behaviour & feel than 300/350 and the rate at which it slows down is faster. These shuttles provide more precision & control, and obviously are costlier
- Having said all these, you may not be able to spot much difference even if you are an advanced amateur. However, I have observed that the skirt starts cracking quicker than 350
● Mavis 2000
- This has got the best flight behaviour of all the above and is mostly used for tournaments if feather shuttle is not used. These shuttles are light and the speed & sturdiness are the closest to feather shuttles
● Feather Shuttles
- Nylon shuttlecocks can never match the flight behaviour of feather shuttles. If you want to gain clear control, feel, touch and master different strokes, you have to play on feather shuttles
- One of the major differences in behaviour with nylon shuttles is the dramatic slowing down of feather shuttles. Professionals and serious badminton players use feather shuttles that helps them gain superior techniques and precision control
● Cap Colour
- The colours on cap indicate the speed of the shuttle. When the climate is hot, the air resistance will be less thus making the shuttle travel faster than in cold conditions. This is compensated by using slower shuttles in hot conditions and faster shuttles in cold conditions
- Green cap is the slowest shuttle. You have to put in more power to push the shuttle to the back of the court. This is more suitable for hot and humid weather or at high altitudes
- Blue cap shuttles have medium speed and is most suited for areas where temperature is around 20 degrees
- Red is the fastest of the three and is best for temperatures around 10 degrees and at low altitudes where the air is denser
- I live in Kerala and I normally pick the green cap
● Shuttle Colour
- Colour of shuttle does not have any significance. Yellow shuttles have got more visibility over the white ones

** Summary **
● All these shuttles look almost the same. The main physical difference you can see is the size of holes in the mesh on the shuttle skirt. There are other differences in the cap material, weight of the cap, etc. that determines the behaviour of the shuttle
● If you are an amateur beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is enough which is cheaper and have the most life
● 300 or 350 is best suited if you are amateur but a serious gamer. I don't really know the difference between 300 and 350, but many people say 350 is a better one
● 500 is recommended if you want to experience shuttle behaviour closer to feathers as an amateur
● 2000 is recommended for aspiring professionals incase you don't have the luxury to practise with feathers
● Having said all these, I have to disclaim that this is from my own experience of playing the game and other players I have spoken with have different opinions, especially on the difference between 300, 350 and 500.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic, and my experience has been somewhat mixed.

First, the positives: The scale is indeed portable and compact, making it easy to store in my kitchen drawer without taking up too much space. It's lightweight, which adds to its portability, and the design is sleek and modern, which fits well with my kitchen decor. The digital display is clear and easy to read, and the scale is user-friendly with simple controls.

However, there are several drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. The accuracy of the scale is quite disappointing, with a margin of error of about ±3 grams. For precise measurements, especially in baking or other culinary activities where accuracy is crucial, this can be quite problematic. I found myself needing to double-check measurements with another scale to ensure accuracy.

Additionally, the material quality leaves much to be desired. The scale is made of low-quality plastic, which feels flimsy and not particularly durable. I'm concerned about its longevity, especially with regular use in a busy kitchen environment. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will last very long without developing cracks or other signs of wear and tear.

In summary, while the beatXP Kitchen Scale has some convenient features and an attractive design, its lack of accuracy and low-quality materials are significant downsides. If precision and durability are important to you, you might want to consider other options on the market.

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a good product. Before this gas stove was used in my home. Near about 20 minutes of waste LPG gas for boilling the egg. But, this product takes only 5> to <10 minutes to boil the 7 eggs together.
But, this has 3 draw back.
1) After autoshut the boiler. If I forget to switch off the plug, after some times the boiler gets auto on.
2) Unable to make half-boil eggs with this product, even folloing the instruction to the letter.
3) Unable to crack the top of the eggs as instructed. Egg shell is very tough, it's not easy to drill. So much force and the eggs will shattered.

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a good product. Before this gas stove was used in my home. Near about 20 minutes of waste LPG gas for boilling the egg. But, this product takes only 5> to <10 minutes to boil the 7 eggs together.
But, this has 3 draw back.
1) After autoshut the boiler. If I forget to switch off the plug, after some times the boiler gets auto on.
2) Unable to make half-boil eggs with this product, even folloing the instruction to the letter.
3) Unable to crack the top of the eggs as instructed. Egg shell is very tough, it's not easy to drill. So much force and the eggs will shattered.

Pidilite Terminator Eco-Friendly Termite Killer Spray| Wood Preservative and Termite, Borer, Insect Repellant Spray| For Home, Kitchen and Offices (1 Ltr),4.0 out of 5 stars,This is like a life saver. Our rented flat has termites in the wood and cabinets. The landlord though did get it treated but it comes back. It's an year now that I am using it . It is very effective. You can see the effectiveness with once spray and the termites lay dead. But you need to spray periodically to maintain it effectiveness.

Cons - Bad and pungent smell that lasts quite a while. The knozzel of the bottle is so bad it stops working after a while. So I transfer it to my own spray bottle.

Other then that it's a good and effective product.

Panasonic 23 L Convection Microwave Oven(NN-CT353BFDG,Black Mirror, 360° Heat Wrap, Magic Grill),4.0 out of 5 stars,Recently we had to replace our Sharp Microwave oven that had given us stellar service for over 15 years. After a detailed comparison of products from multiple manufacturers, we decided to opt for the Panasonic 23L Convection Microwave Oven (model number NN-CT353BFDG). The reason we chose this against the others were the following:

1. We wanted a full function microwave around 21L in size. The functions we needed include grilling, reheating, defrosting, cooking, etc.
2. We wanted a microwave that was able to distribute the heat across the food kept inside.
3. Of course, we wanted one that is priced reasonably.

As I said before, after extensive research, we ordered for the Panasonic. It arrived with a few days of our ordering in spite of the pandemic. After about a month or more of use, here are our observations.

1. The Panasonic fits the requirements we had perfectly.
2. It is at a nice price point. Just around 10K.
3. It works well on whatever tasks we have put it to. It grills, heats, and cooks food perfectly.
4. It does not make to much noise, and the beep it sounds upon completion is what we are used to in Sharp.
5. We were used to have a number keyboard in the Sharp. This does not have it. But it takes only a few moments for us to get used to the new controls in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds.
6. The timer and clock are the same button. To set the time you press the button once. To set the clock, you keep the button pressed for a few seconds and you get the 24H display. You can then set the clock.
7. The Panasonic microwave is a little light in weight. We have kept it atop a rubber mat so that it does not move.
8. Panasonic sent it's engineer the same day the product arrived. He was a little disappointed we had already set the microwave up, and had started using it. But he quickly took a deep breath, and explained the features to us. It is a different matter we knew more about the product then he, as we had read the manual thoroughly a few times.
9. The manual is well written and enough for you to understand how to use the microwave.
10. We are, in general, happy with the choice and have started enjoying using the Panasonic Microwave.

The only issue, if at all any, is that since it does not have a number pad, you can set the timer for say, 17 seconds. It has to be in multiple of 10 seconds. But that is manageable.

Misamo Enterprise PVC Wall Hooks, Pack of 15, Transparent,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased another set of these and I still got no negative feedback. It's a good product and it's perfect for people who live on rent. The process of drilling and having hooks can be lengthy, this saves time and money of course.

These hooks have been a lifesaver in my life at least. I've been using these for a few years and I can say it does what it claims. Yet I must say, these won't hold a lot of weight. If you using these for plants then you must know, that they won't hold their weight for months. Maybe some may but all of them won't. It's not the adhesive that is weak but the hook, it comes off with weight. Maybe you can use it for a smaller plant but not a heavier one. Be careful if you are trying with a heavier pot.

This is good for hanging towels, hand towels especially. I use this behind the bathroom door cus it sticks perfectly on doors. I don't know how strongly it will hold on to a wooden door but it sticks best on titles, plastic kinda doors. Yes, it does stick strongly on walls as well but as long as your wall is perfectly finished.

So anyway, to conclude with. It's perfect to hold light weight stuff.

rts Universal Travel Adapter, International All in One Worldwide Travel Adapter and Wall Charger with USB Ports with Multi Type Power Outlet USB 2.1A,100-250 Voltage Travel Charger (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Does a great job. I have three of these that I use in Europe and they work great although the 2-pin (foldable) plug is a bit thin and doesn't fit too snuggly in the socket. I also think the folding mechanism feels a bit weak. Still, I've used these in Europe and India for the past 2 years or so. Recommended.

Good knight Gold Flash Liquid Vapourizer | Mosquito Repellent Refill | Lavender Fragrance | Pack of 4 (45ml each),5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Good Knight Gold Flash Vapourizer for months, and it's super effective against mosquitoes. The lavender fragrance is a nice touch, not too overpowering. Plus, the pack of 4 lasts long, making it great value. Highly recommend for a peaceful, mosquito-free home!

The flash feature seems to be more effective when there’s a sudden increase in mosquitoes. I noticed fewer mosquito bites, even when we keep the windows open for a breeze. It kicks in when you need it most, but it’s not constantly on, so it feels like it’s working smarter, not harder.

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,The rechargeable desk lamp is a true gem for anyone looking for a blend of style, functionality, and convenience. The sleek design fits perfectly on any desk, adding a modern touch without taking up too much space.

What really sets it apart is the rechargeable feature—no more hunting for outlets or dealing with tangled cords. The battery life is impressive, lasting through long work sessions or late-night reading. Plus, the adjustable brightness levels cater to every need, whether you want a soft glow or bright light for detailed tasks. I’m fully impressed

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,My bed side reading companion.
Nice product build, light weight with a functional neck hoist, which is easily adjustable and stays at the needed position. The warm light at low illumination can work as a night lamp too. Easy to use touch control. Illumination better when plugged in but battery support is also fairly good.

Tends to topple and needs some weight in the pencil holder part to stay put.

A recent purchase but have used other products from this company and they are good. Hoping this one betters the experience

Polycab has a reputation for good customer service, and my experience was no different. I had a few queries regarding installation and operation, and the support team was prompt, friendly, and helpful in addressing my concerns.

Value for Money
In terms of pricing, the Polycab geyser is reasonably priced considering the features and performance it offers. It is a worthy investment for anyone looking for a reliable hot water solution without breaking the bank.

Conclusion
Overall, I am highly satisfied with my Polycab geyser. It delivers on all fronts—design, performance, safety, and efficiency. Whether you're looking for hot water for bathing, cleaning, or cooking, this geyser is an excellent choice.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,5.0 out of 5 stars,That sounds like a great product! I recently purchased bamboo tissues, and I am thoroughly impressed with their quality. Unlike regular paper tissues, these bamboo tissues are incredibly soft and durable. One of the standout features is that a single tissue lasts much longer, reducing waste significantly. This makes them not only a more sustainable choice but also a cost-effective one. I highly recommend these bamboo tissues for anyone looking for a soft, eco-friendly alternative to paper tissues.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,4.0 out of 5 stars,To start, this product's packaging is minimal and crafted from recycled materials, showcasing the company's dedication to sustainability. The tissues themselves are created from 100% natural bamboo, a highly renewable resource that is more environmentally conscious than traditional wood pulp.

Upon my initial use of the tissues, I was pleasantly surprised by their softness and gentle touch on my skin. Often, eco-friendly products can be abrasive and rough, but these tissues are luxuriously soft. Moreover, they possess a 2-ply design, making them sturdy and long-lasting. In the past, I have used other environmentally friendly tissues that easily tore or disintegrated, but these hold up well and leave no residue.

I am also thrilled that this pack contains 100 pulls per box, eliminating the need for frequent restocking. Furthermore, with a pack of 6, I have an ample supply of tissues to last me a considerable amount of time.

What I appreciate most about these tissues is that they are not only beneficial to the environment, but they are also beneficial to my skin. As someone with sensitive skin, I often react to harsh chemicals and fragrances, but these tissues contain no harmful additives.

Overall, I highly recommend the Beco Bamboo Super Soft Facial Tissue for anyone seeking a sustainable and gentle solution for their facial tissue needs. It is a small change that can have a significant impact on the environment, and it is a product that I will continue to purchase in the future.

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),5.0 out of 5 stars,** First Impression **
● The shuttle is yellow in colour with green band at the base. The shuttle base is cork with nylon covering and the skirts are also nylon
● This comes in a carton tube with 6 shuttles packed. The carton has holograms
● The shuttles are manufactured in Japan and is imported by Sunrise Sports

** Product Verification **
● A lot of reviews here say that they think they have got a counterfeit product. You can verify your purchase at Yonex website using the serial number
● The serial number can be revealed by scratching the hologram label. Goto the website 'sunrisetnt' and enter this code there; it's case-sensitive. The site will tell you whether your purchase is genuine or not

** Performance **
● I am an amateur and play on outdoor clay court
● I play with green cap, which is slower in comparison with other caps. However after one or two games, the difference in behaviour disappears
● The recovery of shuttle after the shot is very fast and a problem with this has never been experienced or noted during the play
● The performance in flight path is also not something that gets noticed or influencing while playing badminton as an amateur
● I have been mostly using 350 and a shuttle lasts for around 10 to 15 games before it starts showing signs of disintegration. I replace the shuttle when the first crack appears on the skirt

** Major Differences between popular Shuttlecocks **
● Mavis 10
- Mavis 10 has a nylon base, other shuttles compared here have cork base. So, this lasts longer and best suited for practise sessions
- The flight performance has the least resemblance to feather shuttles. So if you practise for tournaments, I suggest not to use this. If you are a beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is a good choice
● Mavis 300 & 350
- Both these have cork base and nylon feathers
- These shuttles are a tad slower than Mavis 10 and behaviour is closer to feather shuttles in performance when compared with 10
- If you are an amateur who is serious about badminton, this is the best shuttles for you to purchase
- Most of the badminton trainers and coaching centers use either 300 or 350
- I could not experience any difference between 300 and 350, but many people think 350 is better in terms of flight path and durability and my choice of shuttles are 350
● Mavis 500
- This has got cork base and nylon feathers
- These are closer to feather shuttles in terms of flight behaviour & feel than 300/350 and the rate at which it slows down is faster. These shuttles provide more precision & control, and obviously are costlier
- Having said all these, you may not be able to spot much difference even if you are an advanced amateur. However, I have observed that the skirt starts cracking quicker than 350
● Mavis 2000
- This has got the best flight behaviour of all the above and is mostly used for tournaments if feather shuttle is not used. These shuttles are light and the speed & sturdiness are the closest to feather shuttles
● Feather Shuttles
- Nylon shuttlecocks can never match the flight behaviour of feather shuttles. If you want to gain clear control, feel, touch and master different strokes, you have to play on feather shuttles
- One of the major differences in behaviour with nylon shuttles is the dramatic slowing down of feather shuttles. Professionals and serious badminton players use feather shuttles that helps them gain superior techniques and precision control
● Cap Colour
- The colours on cap indicate the speed of the shuttle. When the climate is hot, the air resistance will be less thus making the shuttle travel faster than in cold conditions. This is compensated by using slower shuttles in hot conditions and faster shuttles in cold conditions
- Green cap is the slowest shuttle. You have to put in more power to push the shuttle to the back of the court. This is more suitable for hot and humid weather or at high altitudes
- Blue cap shuttles have medium speed and is most suited for areas where temperature is around 20 degrees
- Red is the fastest of the three and is best for temperatures around 10 degrees and at low altitudes where the air is denser
- I live in Kerala and I normally pick the green cap
● Shuttle Colour
- Colour of shuttle does not have any significance. Yellow shuttles have got more visibility over the white ones

** Summary **
● All these shuttles look almost the same. The main physical difference you can see is the size of holes in the mesh on the shuttle skirt. There are other differences in the cap material, weight of the cap, etc. that determines the behaviour of the shuttle
● If you are an amateur beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is enough which is cheaper and have the most life
● 300 or 350 is best suited if you are amateur but a serious gamer. I don't really know the difference between 300 and 350, but many people say 350 is a better one
● 500 is recommended if you want to experience shuttle behaviour closer to feathers as an amateur
● 2000 is recommended for aspiring professionals incase you don't have the luxury to practise with feathers
● Having said all these, I have to disclaim that this is from my own experience of playing the game and other players I have spoken with have different opinions, especially on the difference between 300, 350 and 500.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic, and my experience has been somewhat mixed.

First, the positives: The scale is indeed portable and compact, making it easy to store in my kitchen drawer without taking up too much space. It's lightweight, which adds to its portability, and the design is sleek and modern, which fits well with my kitchen decor. The digital display is clear and easy to read, and the scale is user-friendly with simple controls.

However, there are several drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. The accuracy of the scale is quite disappointing, with a margin of error of about ±3 grams. For precise measurements, especially in baking or other culinary activities where accuracy is crucial, this can be quite problematic. I found myself needing to double-check measurements with another scale to ensure accuracy.

Additionally, the material quality leaves much to be desired. The scale is made of low-quality plastic, which feels flimsy and not particularly durable. I'm concerned about its longevity, especially with regular use in a busy kitchen environment. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will last very long without developing cracks or other signs of wear and tear.

In summary, while the beatXP Kitchen Scale has some convenient features and an attractive design, its lack of accuracy and low-quality materials are significant downsides. If precision and durability are important to you, you might want to consider other options on the market.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,The beatXP Kitchen Scale KS106 is an adequate product for its price. It's a basic kitchen scale that does the job, but it doesn't exceed expectations. The scale offers decent accuracy and is easy to use, making it a practical choice for those on a budget. However, the build quality and features are quite basic, which is understandable given its low cost.

If you're looking for something that just works without any bells and whistles, this scale fits the bill. But if you require more precision or durability, you might want to consider investing in a higher-end model. Overall, it's an okay product that delivers fair value for its cost.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic, and my experience has been somewhat mixed.

First, the positives: The scale is indeed portable and compact, making it easy to store in my kitchen drawer without taking up too much space. It's lightweight, which adds to its portability, and the design is sleek and modern, which fits well with my kitchen decor. The digital display is clear and easy to read, and the scale is user-friendly with simple controls.

However, there are several drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. The accuracy of the scale is quite disappointing, with a margin of error of about ±3 grams. For precise measurements, especially in baking or other culinary activities where accuracy is crucial, this can be quite problematic. I found myself needing to double-check measurements with another scale to ensure accuracy.

Additionally, the material quality leaves much to be desired. The scale is made of low-quality plastic, which feels flimsy and not particularly durable. I'm concerned about its longevity, especially with regular use in a busy kitchen environment. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will last very long without developing cracks or other signs of wear and tear.

In summary, while the beatXP Kitchen Scale has some convenient features and an attractive design, its lack of accuracy and low-quality materials are significant downsides. If precision and durability are important to you, you might want to consider other options on the market.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,The beatXP Kitchen Scale KS106 is an adequate product for its price. It's a basic kitchen scale that does the job, but it doesn't exceed expectations. The scale offers decent accuracy and is easy to use, making it a practical choice for those on a budget. However, the build quality and features are quite basic, which is understandable given its low cost.

If you're looking for something that just works without any bells and whistles, this scale fits the bill. But if you require more precision or durability, you might want to consider investing in a higher-end model. Overall, it's an okay product that delivers fair value for its cost.

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,5.0 out of 5 stars,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I cannot express how thrilled I am with my recent purchase of the Amazon basics Egg Boiler! This little appliance has truly transformed my mornings and simplified my meal prep routine.

First and foremost, let's talk about efficiency. This egg boiler is lightning-fast, delivering perfectly cooked eggs in a matter of minutes. Whether I'm craving a soft-boiled egg with a gooey center or a firm hard-boiled egg for my salads, this device consistently delivers flawless results every single time.

The simplicity of operation is another standout feature. With just a push of a button, I can select my desired level of doneness and let the egg boiler work its magic. No more hovering over a pot of boiling water, hoping for consistent results. This device takes the guesswork out of egg cooking, which is a game-changer for busy mornings.

Clean-up is a breeze with the removable parts being dishwasher-safe, saving me precious time and effort. The compact design also makes storage a non-issue, fitting perfectly in my kitchen cabinet without taking up too much space.

Additionally, I appreciate the thoughtful design elements incorporated into this egg boiler. The automatic shut-off feature ensures safety and prevents overcooking, giving me peace of mind while multitasking in the kitchen.

Overall, the Amazon basics Egg Boiler has exceeded my expectations in every aspect. It's reliable, efficient, and incredibly easy to use. If you're looking to streamline your breakfast routine and achieve consistently perfect eggs, look no further than this fantastic appliance. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable egg-cooking solution.

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a good product. Before this gas stove was used in my home. Near about 20 minutes of waste LPG gas for boilling the egg. But, this product takes only 5> to <10 minutes to boil the 7 eggs together.
But, this has 3 draw back.
1) After autoshut the boiler. If I forget to switch off the plug, after some times the boiler gets auto on.
2) Unable to make half-boil eggs with this product, even folloing the instruction to the letter.
3) Unable to crack the top of the eggs as instructed. Egg shell is very tough, it's not easy to drill. So much force and the eggs will shattered.

Panasonic 23 L Convection Microwave Oven(NN-CT353BFDG,Black Mirror, 360° Heat Wrap, Magic Grill),4.0 out of 5 stars,Recently we had to replace our Sharp Microwave oven that had given us stellar service for over 15 years. After a detailed comparison of products from multiple manufacturers, we decided to opt for the Panasonic 23L Convection Microwave Oven (model number NN-CT353BFDG). The reason we chose this against the others were the following:

1. We wanted a full function microwave around 21L in size. The functions we needed include grilling, reheating, defrosting, cooking, etc.
2. We wanted a microwave that was able to distribute the heat across the food kept inside.
3. Of course, we wanted one that is priced reasonably.

As I said before, after extensive research, we ordered for the Panasonic. It arrived with a few days of our ordering in spite of the pandemic. After about a month or more of use, here are our observations.

1. The Panasonic fits the requirements we had perfectly.
2. It is at a nice price point. Just around 10K.
3. It works well on whatever tasks we have put it to. It grills, heats, and cooks food perfectly.
4. It does not make to much noise, and the beep it sounds upon completion is what we are used to in Sharp.
5. We were used to have a number keyboard in the Sharp. This does not have it. But it takes only a few moments for us to get used to the new controls in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds.
6. The timer and clock are the same button. To set the time you press the button once. To set the clock, you keep the button pressed for a few seconds and you get the 24H display. You can then set the clock.
7. The Panasonic microwave is a little light in weight. We have kept it atop a rubber mat so that it does not move.
8. Panasonic sent it's engineer the same day the product arrived. He was a little disappointed we had already set the microwave up, and had started using it. But he quickly took a deep breath, and explained the features to us. It is a different matter we knew more about the product then he, as we had read the manual thoroughly a few times.
9. The manual is well written and enough for you to understand how to use the microwave.
10. We are, in general, happy with the choice and have started enjoying using the Panasonic Microwave.

The only issue, if at all any, is that since it does not have a number pad, you can set the timer for say, 17 seconds. It has to be in multiple of 10 seconds. But that is manageable.

Misamo Enterprise PVC Wall Hooks, Pack of 15, Transparent,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased another set of these and I still got no negative feedback. It's a good product and it's perfect for people who live on rent. The process of drilling and having hooks can be lengthy, this saves time and money of course.

These hooks have been a lifesaver in my life at least. I've been using these for a few years and I can say it does what it claims. Yet I must say, these won't hold a lot of weight. If you using these for plants then you must know, that they won't hold their weight for months. Maybe some may but all of them won't. It's not the adhesive that is weak but the hook, it comes off with weight. Maybe you can use it for a smaller plant but not a heavier one. Be careful if you are trying with a heavier pot.

This is good for hanging towels, hand towels especially. I use this behind the bathroom door cus it sticks perfectly on doors. I don't know how strongly it will hold on to a wooden door but it sticks best on titles, plastic kinda doors. Yes, it does stick strongly on walls as well but as long as your wall is perfectly finished.

So anyway, to conclude with. It's perfect to hold light weight stuff.

rts Universal Travel Adapter, International All in One Worldwide Travel Adapter and Wall Charger with USB Ports with Multi Type Power Outlet USB 2.1A,100-250 Voltage Travel Charger (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Does a great job. I have three of these that I use in Europe and they work great although the 2-pin (foldable) plug is a bit thin and doesn't fit too snuggly in the socket. I also think the folding mechanism feels a bit weak. Still, I've used these in Europe and India for the past 2 years or so. Recommended.

Good knight Gold Flash Liquid Vapourizer | Mosquito Repellent Refill | Lavender Fragrance | Pack of 4 (45ml each),5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Good Knight Gold Flash Vapourizer for months, and it's super effective against mosquitoes. The lavender fragrance is a nice touch, not too overpowering. Plus, the pack of 4 lasts long, making it great value. Highly recommend for a peaceful, mosquito-free home!

The flash feature seems to be more effective when there’s a sudden increase in mosquitoes. I noticed fewer mosquito bites, even when we keep the windows open for a breeze. It kicks in when you need it most, but it’s not constantly on, so it feels like it’s working smarter, not harder.

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,The rechargeable desk lamp is a true gem for anyone looking for a blend of style, functionality, and convenience. The sleek design fits perfectly on any desk, adding a modern touch without taking up too much space.

What really sets it apart is the rechargeable feature—no more hunting for outlets or dealing with tangled cords. The battery life is impressive, lasting through long work sessions or late-night reading. Plus, the adjustable brightness levels cater to every need, whether you want a soft glow or bright light for detailed tasks. I’m fully impressed

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,My bed side reading companion.
Nice product build, light weight with a functional neck hoist, which is easily adjustable and stays at the needed position. The warm light at low illumination can work as a night lamp too. Easy to use touch control. Illumination better when plugged in but battery support is also fairly good.

Tends to topple and needs some weight in the pencil holder part to stay put.

A recent purchase but have used other products from this company and they are good. Hoping this one betters the experience

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently added WD-40 to my toolbox, and I'm thrilled with its versatility and effectiveness in various applications. Here's why I find this multipurpose spray to be an invaluable asset:

**Multipurpose Marvel:**
WD-40 truly lives up to its reputation as an all-in-one solution. From acting as a rust remover to a stain remover, lubricant, and more, its countless utilities make it a must-have for both home improvement and automotive purposes.

**Multi-Surface Magic:**
What sets WD-40 apart is its ability to seamlessly work on various surfaces. Whether it's metal, iron, chrome, wood, aluminum, or more, this spray proves its efficacy across a multitude of materials. It has become my go-to solution, not just at home but also for my vehicle and other commercial uses.

**Excellent Lubrication:**
For lubrication needs, WD-40 is unmatched. It has proven to be an excellent choice for ensuring smooth functioning of drawer channels, door hinges, sewing machines, and cycle chains. Its unique formula provides effective lubrication without causing any external damage to these surfaces.

**Powerful Degreasing Agent:**
The spray's prowess extends to effective degreasing. It effortlessly removes grime, grease, and smudges from various surfaces, including wooden tables, countertops, and metallic surfaces of vehicles. This quality makes it a reliable degreasing agent for a variety of applications.

**Active Cleaning Agent:**
WD-40 is not just a lubricant and degreaser; it's also a formidable cleaning agent. It excels at removing stains, dirt, sticky residues, and dust particles. I've witnessed its effectiveness on automobile parts, cleaning spark plugs, and restoring the shine to rusting showpieces.

**Personal Satisfaction:**
My personal experience with WD-40 has been extremely satisfying, particularly in cleaning my vehicle's chain. It brought back the gleam, making it look as good as new. The ease of use and the wide range of applications have made it an indispensable part of my maintenance routine.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, WD-40 has proven to be a game-changer in home and auto care. Its multipurpose functionality, compatibility with various surfaces, and effectiveness in lubrication, degreasing, and cleaning make it an essential tool for DIY enthusiasts and professionals alike.

Though these locks were expensive, I was planning to discard it. Then I decided to take a chance and ordered WD-40. It WORKED beautifully. The locks got loosened, almost miraculously! It does not work immediately after spraying. It does not seem to be a lubricant. I sprayed the locks with WD-40 and left them for 10 hours, and then tried to unlock them, it got UNLICKED, as if new!

I was literally thought of filing a claim as well for those scratches. The one i have attached in media is the smallest one there were many more worse than this.
I bought this with no expectations and very surprised by the results i got. Almost 80-90% of the scratches were removed completely when rubbed well with a microfiber cloth.
If you have scratches on your car, do not doubt a bit and go ahead with this one.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,5.0 out of 5 stars,That sounds like a great product! I recently purchased bamboo tissues, and I am thoroughly impressed with their quality. Unlike regular paper tissues, these bamboo tissues are incredibly soft and durable. One of the standout features is that a single tissue lasts much longer, reducing waste significantly. This makes them not only a more sustainable choice but also a cost-effective one.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,4.0 out of 5 stars,To start, this product's packaging is minimal and crafted from recycled materials, showcasing the company's dedication to sustainability. The tissues themselves are created from 100% natural bamboo, a highly renewable resource that is more environmentally conscious than traditional wood pulp.

Upon my initial use of the tissues, I was pleasantly surprised by their softness and gentle touch on my skin. Often, eco-friendly products can be abrasive and rough, but these tissues are luxuriously soft. Moreover, they possess a 2-ply design, making them sturdy and long-lasting. In the past, I have used other environmentally friendly tissues that easily tore or disintegrated, but these hold up well and leave no residue.

I am also thrilled that this pack contains 100 pulls per box, eliminating the need for frequent restocking. Furthermore, with a pack of 6, I have an ample supply of tissues to last me a considerable amount of time.

What I appreciate most about these tissues is that they are not only beneficial to the environment, but they are also beneficial to my skin. As someone with sensitive skin, I often react to harsh chemicals and fragrances, but these tissues contain no harmful additives.

Overall, I highly recommend the Beco Bamboo Super Soft Facial Tissue for anyone seeking a sustainable and gentle solution for their facial tissue needs. It is a small change that can have a significant impact on the environment, and it is a product that I will continue to purchase in the future.

I highly recommend these bamboo tissues for anyone looking for a soft, eco-friendly alternative to paper tissues.

NEWISH Pepper Spray for self Defence Small Pocket Size - Reliable and Effective Self-Defense 50 Time Spray,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this for my sister who use to travel frequently.
When we tried this spray at home, within 4-5 secs there was very spicy, itchy and unbearable odour in surrounding that we can't even stand there for 30 seconds. Intensity is very high and unbearable.
Impressed with the performance and it is pocket size so you can easily carry it.
Recommend this to every girl as a first aid for protection.

But please be very careful while using it, don't spray it directly in the eyes of another person until and unless you're in danger because it can cause lose in eye sight.

NEWISH Pepper Spray for self Defence Small Pocket Size - Reliable and Effective Self-Defense 50 Time Spray,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this Red Cop Pepper Spray for self defence after reading some positive reviews on Amazon. I was looking for effective spray that could protect me from thieves and criminals at night. I have to say that this product has exceeded my expectations.

The spray is very easy to use and has a good range of about upto 15 feet. The nozzle always points towards the attacker's face, which ensures accuracy and prevents accidental spraying.

The spray is also very handy and can be placed anywhere, with just little space allocation. I usually carry it in my pocket, and sometimes in my bag. The spray is legal to use. I felt very safe and confident with this spray.

Overall, I am very satisfied with this Red Cop Pepper spray for self defence. It is a powerful and affordable product that gives me peace of mind and security. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to protect themselves from harm.

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),5.0 out of 5 stars,** First Impression **
● The shuttle is yellow in colour with green band at the base. The shuttle base is cork with nylon covering and the skirts are also nylon
● This comes in a carton tube with 6 shuttles packed. The carton has holograms
● The shuttles are manufactured in Japan and is imported by Sunrise Sports

** Product Verification **
● A lot of reviews here say that they think they have got a counterfeit product. You can verify your purchase at Yonex website using the serial number
● The serial number can be revealed by scratching the hologram label. Goto the website 'sunrisetnt' and enter this code there; it's case-sensitive. The site will tell you whether your purchase is genuine or not

** Performance **
● I am an amateur and play on outdoor clay court
● I play with green cap, which is slower in comparison with other caps. However after one or two games, the difference in behaviour disappears
● The recovery of shuttle after the shot is very fast and a problem with this has never been experienced or noted during the play
● The performance in flight path is also not something that gets noticed or influencing while playing badminton as an amateur
● I have been mostly using 350 and a shuttle lasts for around 10 to 15 games before it starts showing signs of disintegration. I replace the shuttle when the first crack appears on the skirt

** Major Differences between popular Shuttlecocks **
● Mavis 10
- Mavis 10 has a nylon base, other shuttles compared here have cork base. So, this lasts longer and best suited for practise sessions
- The flight performance has the least resemblance to feather shuttles. So if you practise for tournaments, I suggest not to use this. If you are a beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is a good choice
● Mavis 300 & 350
- Both these have cork base and nylon feathers
- These shuttles are a tad slower than Mavis 10 and behaviour is closer to feather shuttles in performance when compared with 10
- If you are an amateur who is serious about badminton, this is the best shuttles for you to purchase
- Most of the badminton trainers and coaching centers use either 300 or 350
- I could not experience any difference between 300 and 350, but many people think 350 is better in terms of flight path and durability and my choice of shuttles are 350
● Mavis 500
- This has got cork base and nylon feathers
- These are closer to feather shuttles in terms of flight behaviour & feel than 300/350 and the rate at which it slows down is faster. These shuttles provide more precision & control, and obviously are costlier
- Having said all these, you may not be able to spot much difference even if you are an advanced amateur. However, I have observed that the skirt starts cracking quicker than 350
● Mavis 2000
- This has got the best flight behaviour of all the above and is mostly used for tournaments if feather shuttle is not used. These shuttles are light and the speed & sturdiness are the closest to feather shuttles
● Feather Shuttles
- Nylon shuttlecocks can never match the flight behaviour of feather shuttles. If you want to gain clear control, feel, touch and master different strokes, you have to play on feather shuttles
- One of the major differences in behaviour with nylon shuttles is the dramatic slowing down of feather shuttles. Professionals and serious badminton players use feather shuttles that helps them gain superior techniques and precision control
● Cap Colour
- The colours on cap indicate the speed of the shuttle. When the climate is hot, the air resistance will be less thus making the shuttle travel faster than in cold conditions. This is compensated by using slower shuttles in hot conditions and faster shuttles in cold conditions
- Green cap is the slowest shuttle. You have to put in more power to push the shuttle to the back of the court. This is more suitable for hot and humid weather or at high altitudes
- Blue cap shuttles have medium speed and is most suited for areas where temperature is around 20 degrees
- Red is the fastest of the three and is best for temperatures around 10 degrees and at low altitudes where the air is denser
- I live in Kerala and I normally pick the green cap
● Shuttle Colour
- Colour of shuttle does not have any significance. Yellow shuttles have got more visibility over the white ones

** Summary **
● All these shuttles look almost the same. The main physical difference you can see is the size of holes in the mesh on the shuttle skirt. There are other differences in the cap material, weight of the cap, etc. that determines the behaviour of the shuttle
● If you are an amateur beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is enough which is cheaper and have the most life
● 300 or 350 is best suited if you are amateur but a serious gamer. I don't really know the difference between 300 and 350, but many people say 350 is a better one
● 500 is recommended if you want to experience shuttle behaviour closer to feathers as an amateur
● 2000 is recommended for aspiring professionals incase you don't have the luxury to practise with feathers
● Having said all these, I have to disclaim that this is from my own experience of playing the game and other players I have spoken with have different opinions, especially on the difference between 300, 350 and 500.

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),5.0 out of 5 stars,Never ever play in rain with the shuttle or near water if it gets wet it will loose its adhesive.
It will easily go on for 3 weeks on moderate play
2 weeks for aggressive play
Depending upon your use

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),5.0 out of 5 stars,I tried most of the shuttle like ... decathlon shuttle300, cosco 777, mavis2000 but all are uncomparable to mavis350.
I love it, thank you 😊
It a value for money
And I enjoy the game by using it
I can control my direction and speed

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought red one thinking it's going to be best shuttles for indoor, but all the shuttles in the box are defective, none of the shuttle fly properly. Never buy non returnable item from Amazon, replaceable items are mostly defective. Better but costly shuttles from local shop.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic, and my experience has been somewhat mixed.

First, the positives: The scale is indeed portable and compact, making it easy to store in my kitchen drawer without taking up too much space. It's lightweight, which adds to its portability, and the design is sleek and modern, which fits well with my kitchen decor. The digital display is clear and easy to read, and the scale is user-friendly with simple controls.

However, there are several drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. The accuracy of the scale is quite disappointing, with a margin of error of about ±3 grams. For precise measurements, especially in baking or other culinary activities where accuracy is crucial, this can be quite problematic. I found myself needing to double-check measurements with another scale to ensure accuracy.

Additionally, the material quality leaves much to be desired. The scale is made of low-quality plastic, which feels flimsy and not particularly durable. I'm concerned about its longevity, especially with regular use in a busy kitchen environment. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will last very long without developing cracks or other signs of wear and tear.

In summary, while the beatXP Kitchen Scale has some convenient features and an attractive design, its lack of accuracy and low-quality materials are significant downsides. If precision and durability are important to you, you might want to consider other options on the market.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,The beatXP Kitchen Scale KS106 is an adequate product for its price. It's a basic kitchen scale that does the job, but it doesn't exceed expectations. The scale offers decent accuracy and is easy to use, making it a practical choice for those on a budget. However, the build quality and features are quite basic, which is understandable given its low cost.

If you're looking for something that just works without any bells and whistles, this scale fits the bill. But if you require more precision or durability, you might want to consider investing in a higher-end model. Overall, it's an okay product that delivers fair value for its cost.

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,5.0 out of 5 stars,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I cannot express how thrilled I am with my recent purchase of the Amazon basics Egg Boiler! This little appliance has truly transformed my mornings and simplified my meal prep routine.

First and foremost, let's talk about efficiency. This egg boiler is lightning-fast, delivering perfectly cooked eggs in a matter of minutes. Whether I'm craving a soft-boiled egg with a gooey center or a firm hard-boiled egg for my salads, this device consistently delivers flawless results every single time.

The simplicity of operation is another standout feature. With just a push of a button, I can select my desired level of doneness and let the egg boiler work its magic. No more hovering over a pot of boiling water, hoping for consistent results. This device takes the guesswork out of egg cooking, which is a game-changer for busy mornings.

Clean-up is a breeze with the removable parts being dishwasher-safe, saving me precious time and effort. The compact design also makes storage a non-issue, fitting perfectly in my kitchen cabinet without taking up too much space.

Additionally, I appreciate the thoughtful design elements incorporated into this egg boiler. The automatic shut-off feature ensures safety and prevents overcooking, giving me peace of mind while multitasking in the kitchen.

Overall, the Amazon basics Egg Boiler has exceeded my expectations in every aspect. It's reliable, efficient, and incredibly easy to use. If you're looking to streamline your breakfast routine and achieve consistently perfect eggs, look no further than this fantastic appliance. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable egg-cooking solution.

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a good product. Before this gas stove was used in my home. Near about 20 minutes of waste LPG gas for boilling the egg. But, this product takes only 5> to <10 minutes to boil the 7 eggs together.
But, this has 3 draw back.
1) After autoshut the boiler. If I forget to switch off the plug, after some times the boiler gets auto on.
2) Unable to make half-boil eggs with this product, even folloing the instruction to the letter.
3) Unable to crack the top of the eggs as instructed. Egg shell is very tough, it's not easy to drill. So much force and the eggs will shattered.

JIALTO Adhesive Hooks Heavy Duty Wall Hooks, Nail Hook for Hanging Coat, Hat,Towel Robe Hook Rack Wall Mount- Bathroom and Bedroom Hooks for Wall Without Drilling (Nail Hook Trasparent 10 Pack),4.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality. But price is high for such products where these types of products actually made of interest Rs 1.00 /- even we include all the travel, package, promotion, retail margin etc etc...that should be Rs. 4 - Rs 5 /- per peace or even less.

Price is a big Factor. Otherwise product is good.

Panasonic 23 L Convection Microwave Oven(NN-CT353BFDG,Black Mirror, 360° Heat Wrap, stainless steel cavity, Magic Grill),4.0 out of 5 stars,Recently we had to replace our Sharp Microwave oven that had given us stellar service for over 15 years. After a detailed comparison of products from multiple manufacturers, we decided to opt for the Panasonic 23L Convection Microwave Oven (model number NN-CT353BFDG). The reason we chose this against the others were the following:

1. We wanted a full function microwave around 21L in size. The functions we needed include grilling, reheating, defrosting, cooking, etc.
2. We wanted a microwave that was able to distribute the heat across the food kept inside.
3. Of course, we wanted one that is priced reasonably.

As I said before, after extensive research, we ordered for the Panasonic. It arrived with a few days of our ordering in spite of the pandemic. After about a month or more of use, here are our observations.

1. The Panasonic fits the requirements we had perfectly.
2. It is at a nice price point. Just around 10K.
3. It works well on whatever tasks we have put it to. It grills, heats, and cooks food perfectly.
4. It does not make to much noise, and the beep it sounds upon completion is what we are used to in Sharp.
5. We were used to have a number keyboard in the Sharp. This does not have it. But it takes only a few moments for us to get used to the new controls in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds.
6. The timer and clock are the same button. To set the time you press the button once. To set the clock, you keep the button pressed for a few seconds and you get the 24H display. You can then set the clock.
7. The Panasonic microwave is a little light in weight. We have kept it atop a rubber mat so that it does not move.
8. Panasonic sent it's engineer the same day the product arrived. He was a little disappointed we had already set the microwave up, and had started using it. But he quickly took a deep breath, and explained the features to us. It is a different matter we knew more about the product then he, as we had read the manual thoroughly a few times.
9. The manual is well written and enough for you to understand how to use the microwave.
10. We are, in general, happy with the choice and have started enjoying using the Panasonic Microwave.

The only issue, if at all any, is that since it does not have a number pad, you can set the timer for say, 17 seconds. It has to be in multiple of 10 seconds. But that is manageable.

Misamo Enterprise PVC Wall Hooks, Pack of 15, Transparent,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased another set of these and I still got no negative feedback. It's a good product and it's perfect for people who live on rent. The process of drilling and having hooks can be lengthy, this saves time and money of course.

These hooks have been a lifesaver in my life at least. I've been using these for a few years and I can say it does what it claims. Yet I must say, these won't hold a lot of weight. If you using these for plants then you must know, that they won't hold their weight for months. Maybe some may but all of them won't. It's not the adhesive that is weak but the hook, it comes off with weight. Maybe you can use it for a smaller plant but not a heavier one. Be careful if you are trying with a heavier pot.

This is good for hanging towels, hand towels especially. I use this behind the bathroom door cus it sticks perfectly on doors. I don't know how strongly it will hold on to a wooden door but it sticks best on titles, plastic kinda doors. Yes, it does stick strongly on walls as well but as long as your wall is perfectly finished.

So anyway, to conclude with. It's perfect to hold light weight stuff.

Good knight Gold Flash Liquid Vapourizer | Mosquito Repellent Refill | Lavender Fragrance | Pack of 4 (45ml each),5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Good Knight Gold Flash Vapourizer for months, and it's super effective against mosquitoes. The lavender fragrance is a nice touch, not too overpowering. Plus, the pack of 4 lasts long, making it great value. Highly recommend for a peaceful, mosquito-free home!

The flash feature seems to be more effective when there’s a sudden increase in mosquitoes. I noticed fewer mosquito bites, even when we keep the windows open for a breeze. It kicks in when you need it most, but it’s not constantly on, so it feels like it’s working smarter, not harder.

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,The rechargeable desk lamp is a true gem for anyone looking for a blend of style, functionality, and convenience. The sleek design fits perfectly on any desk, adding a modern touch without taking up too much space.

What really sets it apart is the rechargeable feature—no more hunting for outlets or dealing with tangled cords. The battery life is impressive, lasting through long work sessions or late-night reading. Plus, the adjustable brightness levels cater to every need, whether you want a soft glow or bright light for detailed tasks. I’m fully impressed

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,My bed side reading companion.
Nice product build, light weight with a functional neck hoist, which is easily adjustable and stays at the needed position. The warm light at low illumination can work as a night lamp too. Easy to use touch control. Illumination better when plugged in but battery support is also fairly good.

Tends to topple and needs some weight in the pencil holder part to stay put.

A recent purchase but have used other products from this company and they are good. Hoping this one betters the experience

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently added WD-40 to my toolbox, and I'm thrilled with its versatility and effectiveness in various applications. Here's why I find this multipurpose spray to be an invaluable asset:

**Multipurpose Marvel:**
WD-40 truly lives up to its reputation as an all-in-one solution. From acting as a rust remover to a stain remover, lubricant, and more, its countless utilities make it a must-have for both home improvement and automotive purposes.

**Multi-Surface Magic:**
What sets WD-40 apart is its ability to seamlessly work on various surfaces. Whether it's metal, iron, chrome, wood, aluminum, or more, this spray proves its efficacy across a multitude of materials. It has become my go-to solution, not just at home but also for my vehicle and other commercial uses.

**Excellent Lubrication:**
For lubrication needs, WD-40 is unmatched. It has proven to be an excellent choice for ensuring smooth functioning of drawer channels, door hinges, sewing machines, and cycle chains. Its unique formula provides effective lubrication without causing any external damage to these surfaces.

**Powerful Degreasing Agent:**
The spray's prowess extends to effective degreasing. It effortlessly removes grime, grease, and smudges from various surfaces, including wooden tables, countertops, and metallic surfaces of vehicles. This quality makes it a reliable degreasing agent for a variety of applications.

**Active Cleaning Agent:**
WD-40 is not just a lubricant and degreaser; it's also a formidable cleaning agent. It excels at removing stains, dirt, sticky residues, and dust particles. I've witnessed its effectiveness on automobile parts, cleaning spark plugs, and restoring the shine to rusting showpieces.

**Personal Satisfaction:**
My personal experience with WD-40 has been extremely satisfying, particularly in cleaning my vehicle's chain. It brought back the gleam, making it look as good as new. The ease of use and the wide range of applications have made it an indispensable part of my maintenance routine.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, WD-40 has proven to be a game-changer in home and auto care. Its multipurpose functionality, compatibility with various surfaces, and effectiveness in lubrication, degreasing, and cleaning make it an essential tool for DIY enthusiasts and professionals alike. I highly recommend WD-40 for anyone seeking a reliable, all-in-one solution for their maintenance needs.

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,I had a couple of Godrej locks whuch got rusted and thus become unusable as they were exposed to rainwater. Though these locks were expensive, I was planning to discard it. Then I decided to take a chance and ordered WD-40. It WORKED beautifully. The locks got loosened, almost miraculously! It does not work immediately after spraying. It does not seem to be a lubricant. I sprayed the locks with WD-40 and left them for 10 hours, and then tried to unlock them, it got UNLICKED, as if new! I recommend it.

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,You can not miss this to have it if you own a car. This thing of a piece works like magic for me. I had so many scratches on my new car and I was very afraid that I might get those parts repainted. I was literally thought of filing a claim as well for those scratches. The one i have attached in media is the smallest one there were many more worse than this.
I bought this with no expectations and very surprised by the results i got. Almost 80-90% of the scratches were removed completely when rubbed well with a microfiber cloth.
If you have scratches on your car, do not doubt a bit and go ahead with this one.

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently added WD-40 to my toolbox, and I'm thrilled with its versatility and effectiveness in various applications. Here's why I find this multipurpose spray to be an invaluable asset:

**Multipurpose Marvel:**
WD-40 truly lives up to its reputation as an all-in-one solution. From acting as a rust remover to a stain remover, lubricant, and more, its countless utilities make it a must-have for both home improvement and automotive purposes.

**Multi-Surface Magic:**
What sets WD-40 apart is its ability to seamlessly work on various surfaces. Whether it's metal, iron, chrome, wood, aluminum, or more, this spray proves its efficacy across a multitude of materials. It has become my go-to solution, not just at home but also for my vehicle and other commercial uses.

**Excellent Lubrication:**
For lubrication needs, WD-40 is unmatched. It has proven to be an excellent choice for ensuring smooth functioning of drawer channels, door hinges, sewing machines, and cycle chains. Its unique formula provides effective lubrication without causing any external damage to these surfaces.

**Powerful Degreasing Agent:**
The spray's prowess extends to effective degreasing. It effortlessly removes grime, grease, and smudges from various surfaces, including wooden tables, countertops, and metallic surfaces of vehicles. This quality makes it a reliable degreasing agent for a variety of applications.

**Active Cleaning Agent:**
WD-40 is not just a lubricant and degreaser; it's also a formidable cleaning agent. It excels at removing stains, dirt, sticky residues, and dust particles. I've witnessed its effectiveness on automobile parts, cleaning spark plugs, and restoring the shine to rusting showpieces.

**Personal Satisfaction:**
My personal experience with WD-40 has been extremely satisfying, particularly in cleaning my vehicle's chain. It brought back the gleam, making it look as good as new. The ease of use and the wide range of applications have made it an indispensable part of my maintenance routine.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, WD-40 has proven to be a game-changer in home and auto care.

I highly recommend WD-40 for anyone seeking a reliable, all-in-one solution for their maintenance needs.

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,I had a couple of Godrej locks whuch got rusted and thus become unusable as they were exposed to rainwater. Though these locks were expensive, I was planning to discard it. Then I decided to take a chance and ordered WD-40. It WORKED beautifully. The locks got loosened, almost miraculously! It does not work immediately after spraying. It does not seem to be a lubricant. I sprayed the locks with WD-40 and left them for 10 hours, and then tried to unlock them, it got UNLICKED, as if new! I recommend it.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,5.0 out of 5 stars,That sounds like a great product! I recently purchased bamboo tissues, and I am thoroughly impressed with their quality. Unlike regular paper tissues, these bamboo tissues are incredibly soft and durable. One of the standout features is that a single tissue lasts much longer, reducing waste significantly. This makes them not only a more sustainable choice but also a cost-effective one. I highly recommend these bamboo tissues for anyone looking for a soft, eco-friendly alternative to paper tissues.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,4.0 out of 5 stars,To start, this product's packaging is minimal and crafted from recycled materials, showcasing the company's dedication to sustainability. The tissues themselves are created from 100% natural bamboo, a highly renewable resource that is more environmentally conscious than traditional wood pulp.

Upon my initial use of the tissues, I was pleasantly surprised by their softness and gentle touch on my skin. Often, eco-friendly products can be abrasive and rough, but these tissues are luxuriously soft. Moreover, they possess a 2-ply design, making them sturdy and long-lasting. In the past, I have used other environmentally friendly tissues that easily tore or disintegrated, but these hold up well and leave no residue.

I am also thrilled that this pack contains 100 pulls per box, eliminating the need for frequent restocking. Furthermore, with a pack of 6, I have an ample supply of tissues to last me a considerable amount of time.

What I appreciate most about these tissues is that they are not only beneficial to the environment, but they are also beneficial to my skin. As someone with sensitive skin, I often react to harsh chemicals and fragrances, but these tissues contain no harmful additives.

Overall, I highly recommend the Beco Bamboo Super Soft Facial Tissue for anyone seeking a sustainable and gentle solution for their facial tissue needs. It is a small change that can have a significant impact on the environment, and it is a product that I will continue to purchase in the future.

NEWISH Pepper Spray for self Defence Small Pocket Size - Reliable and Effective Self-Defense 50 Time Spray,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this Red Cop Pepper Spray for self defence after reading some positive reviews on Amazon. I was looking for effective spray that could protect me from thieves and criminals at night. I have to say that this product has exceeded my expectations.

The spray is very easy to use and has a good range of about upto 15 feet. The nozzle always points towards the attacker's face, which ensures accuracy and prevents accidental spraying.

The spray is also very handy and can be placed anywhere, with just little space allocation. I usually carry it in my pocket, and sometimes in my bag. The spray is legal to use. I felt very safe and confident with this spray.

Overall, I am very satisfied with this Red Cop Pepper spray for self defence. It is a powerful and affordable product that gives me peace of mind and security. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to protect themselves from harm.

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),5.0 out of 5 stars,** First Impression **
● The shuttle is yellow in colour with green band at the base. The shuttle base is cork with nylon covering and the skirts are also nylon
● This comes in a carton tube with 6 shuttles packed. The carton has holograms
● The shuttles are manufactured in Japan and is imported by Sunrise Sports

** Product Verification **
● A lot of reviews here say that they think they have got a counterfeit product. You can verify your purchase at Yonex website using the serial number
● The serial number can be revealed by scratching the hologram label. Goto the website 'sunrisetnt' and enter this code there; it's case-sensitive. The site will tell you whether your purchase is genuine or not

** Performance **
● I am an amateur and play on outdoor clay court
● I play with green cap, which is slower in comparison with other caps. However after one or two games, the difference in behaviour disappears
● The recovery of shuttle after the shot is very fast and a problem with this has never been experienced or noted during the play
● The performance in flight path is also not something that gets noticed or influencing while playing badminton as an amateur
● I have been mostly using 350 and a shuttle lasts for around 10 to 15 games before it starts showing signs of disintegration. I replace the shuttle when the first crack appears on the skirt

** Major Differences between popular Shuttlecocks **
● Mavis 10
- Mavis 10 has a nylon base, other shuttles compared here have cork base. So, this lasts longer and best suited for practise sessions
- The flight performance has the least resemblance to feather shuttles. So if you practise for tournaments, I suggest not to use this. If you are a beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is a good choice
● Mavis 300 & 350
- Both these have cork base and nylon feathers
- These shuttles are a tad slower than Mavis 10 and behaviour is closer to feather shuttles in performance when compared with 10
- If you are an amateur who is serious about badminton, this is the best shuttles for you to purchase
- Most of the badminton trainers and coaching centers use either 300 or 350
- I could not experience any difference between 300 and 350, but many people think 350 is better in terms of flight path and durability and my choice of shuttles are 350
● Mavis 500
- This has got cork base and nylon feathers
- These are closer to feather shuttles in terms of flight behaviour & feel than 300/350 and the rate at which it slows down is faster. These shuttles provide more precision & control, and obviously are costlier
- Having said all these, you may not be able to spot much difference even if you are an advanced amateur. However, I have observed that the skirt starts cracking quicker than 350
● Mavis 2000
- This has got the best flight behaviour of all the above and is mostly used for tournaments if feather shuttle is not used. These shuttles are light and the speed & sturdiness are the closest to feather shuttles
● Feather Shuttles
- Nylon shuttlecocks can never match the flight behaviour of feather shuttles. If you want to gain clear control, feel, touch and master different strokes, you have to play on feather shuttles
- One of the major differences in behaviour with nylon shuttles is the dramatic slowing down of feather shuttles. Professionals and serious badminton players use feather shuttles that helps them gain superior techniques and precision control
● Cap Colour
- The colours on cap indicate the speed of the shuttle. When the climate is hot, the air resistance will be less thus making the shuttle travel faster than in cold conditions. This is compensated by using slower shuttles in hot conditions and faster shuttles in cold conditions
- Green cap is the slowest shuttle. You have to put in more power to push the shuttle to the back of the court. This is more suitable for hot and humid weather or at high altitudes
- Blue cap shuttles have medium speed and is most suited for areas where temperature is around 20 degrees
- Red is the fastest of the three and is best for temperatures around 10 degrees and at low altitudes where the air is denser
- I live in Kerala and I normally pick the green cap
● Shuttle Colour
- Colour of shuttle does not have any significance. Yellow shuttles have got more visibility over the white ones

** Summary **
● All these shuttles look almost the same. The main physical difference you can see is the size of holes in the mesh on the shuttle skirt. There are other differences in the cap material, weight of the cap, etc. that determines the behaviour of the shuttle
● If you are an amateur beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is enough which is cheaper and have the most life
● 300 or 350 is best suited if you are amateur but a serious gamer. I don't really know the difference between 300 and 350, but many people say 350 is a better one
● 500 is recommended if you want to experience shuttle behaviour closer to feathers as an amateur
● 2000 is recommended for aspiring professionals incase you don't have the luxury to practise with feathers
● Having said all these, I have to disclaim that this is from my own experience of playing the game and other players I have spoken with have different opinions, especially on the difference between 300, 350 and 500.

● The recovery of shuttle after the shot is very fast and a problem with this has never been experienced or noted during the play
● The performance in flight path is also not something that gets noticed or influencing while playing badminton as an amateur
● I have been mostly using 350 and a shuttle lasts for around 10 to 15 games before it starts showing signs of disintegration. I replace the shuttle when the first crack appears on the skirt

** Major Differences between popular Shuttlecocks **
● Mavis 10
- Mavis 10 has a nylon base, other shuttles compared here have cork base. So, this lasts longer and best suited for practise sessions
- The flight performance has the least resemblance to feather shuttles. So if you practise for tournaments, I suggest not to use this. If you are a beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is a good choice
● Mavis 300 & 350
- Both these have cork base and nylon feathers
- These shuttles are a tad slower than Mavis 10 and behaviour is closer to feather shuttles in performance when compared with 10
- If you are an amateur who is serious about badminton, this is the best shuttles for you to purchase
- Most of the badminton trainers and coaching centers use either 300 or 350
- I could not experience any difference between 300 and 350, but many people think 350 is better in terms of flight path and durability and my choice of shuttles are 350
● Mavis 500
- This has got cork base and nylon feathers
- These are closer to feather shuttles in terms of flight behaviour & feel than 300/350 and the rate at which it slows down is faster. These shuttles provide more precision & control, and obviously are costlier
- Having said all these, you may not be able to spot much difference even if you are an advanced amateur. However, I have observed that the skirt starts cracking quicker than 350
● Mavis 2000
- This has got the best flight behaviour of all the above and is mostly used for tournaments if feather shuttle is not used. These shuttles are light and the speed & sturdiness are the closest to feather shuttles
● Feather Shuttles
- Nylon shuttlecocks can never match the flight behaviour of feather shuttles. If you want to gain clear control, feel, touch and master different strokes, you have to play on feather shuttles
- One of the major differences in behaviour with nylon shuttles is the dramatic slowing down of feather shuttles. Professionals and serious badminton players use feather shuttles that helps them gain superior techniques and precision control
● Cap Colour
- The colours on cap indicate the speed of the shuttle. When the climate is hot, the air resistance will be less thus making the shuttle travel faster than in cold conditions. This is compensated by using slower shuttles in hot conditions and faster shuttles in cold conditions
- Green cap is the slowest shuttle. You have to put in more power to push the shuttle to the back of the court. This is more suitable for hot and humid weather or at high altitudes
- Blue cap shuttles have medium speed and is most suited for areas where temperature is around 20 degrees
- Red is the fastest of the three and is best for temperatures around 10 degrees and at low altitudes where the air is denser
- I live in Kerala and I normally pick the green cap
● Shuttle Colour
- Colour of shuttle does not have any significance. Yellow shuttles have got more visibility over the white ones

** Summary **
● All these shuttles look almost the same. The main physical difference you can see is the size of holes in the mesh on the shuttle skirt. There are other differences in the cap material, weight of the cap, etc. that determines the behaviour of the shuttle
● If you are an amateur beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is enough which is cheaper and have the most life
● 300 or 350 is best suited if you are amateur but a serious gamer. I don't really know the difference between 300 and 350, but many people say 350 is a better one
● 500 is recommended if you want to experience shuttle behaviour closer to feathers as an amateur
● 2000 is recommended for aspiring professionals incase you don't have the luxury to practise with feathers
● Having said all these, I have to disclaim that this is from my own experience of playing the game and other players I have spoken with have different opinions, especially on the difference between 300, 350 and 500.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic, and my experience has been somewhat mixed.

First, the positives: The scale is indeed portable and compact, making it easy to store in my kitchen drawer without taking up too much space. It's lightweight, which adds to its portability, and the design is sleek and modern, which fits well with my kitchen decor. The digital display is clear and easy to read, and the scale is user-friendly with simple controls.

However, there are several drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. The accuracy of the scale is quite disappointing, with a margin of error of about ±3 grams. For precise measurements, especially in baking or other culinary activities where accuracy is crucial, this can be quite problematic. I found myself needing to double-check measurements with another scale to ensure accuracy.

Additionally, the material quality leaves much to be desired. The scale is made of low-quality plastic, which feels flimsy and not particularly durable. I'm concerned about its longevity, especially with regular use in a busy kitchen environment. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will last very long without developing cracks or other signs of wear and tear.

In summary, while the beatXP Kitchen Scale has some convenient features and an attractive design, its lack of accuracy and low-quality materials are significant downsides. If precision and durability are important to you, you might want to consider other options on the market.

It's a basic kitchen scale that does the job, but it doesn't exceed expectations. The scale offers decent accuracy and is easy to use, making it a practical choice for those on a budget. However, the build quality and features are quite basic, which is understandable given its low cost.

If you're looking for something that just works without any bells and whistles, this scale fits the bill. But if you require more precision or durability, you might want to consider investing in a higher-end model. Overall, it's an okay product that delivers fair value for its cost.

VOLTURI Fridge Storage Boxes (Pack of 6), Fridge Organisers with Removable Drain Plate, Fridge Storage Containers Keeps Fruits, Vegetables, Pantry Items Stackable, Space-Saving Storage Box Set, 1.5L,4.0 out of 5 stars,Liked the product. Could be more happy if the depth of the containers r little deeper, especially for vegetables as we used for. Other thing is covers r can't be closed easily, it needs attention to do so and even gets loose subsequently. Otherwise material seems not bad. Size options or assorted size may help people to choose as per their requirement.

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a good product. Before this gas stove was used in my home. Near about 20 minutes of waste LPG gas for boilling the egg. But, this product takes only 5> to <10 minutes to boil the 7 eggs together.
But, this has 3 draw back.
1) After autoshut the boiler. If I forget to switch off the plug, after some times the boiler gets auto on.
2) Unable to make half-boil eggs with this product, even folloing the instruction to the letter.
3) Unable to crack the top of the eggs as instructed. Egg shell is very tough, it's not easy to drill. So much force and the eggs will shattered.

JIALTO Adhesive Hooks Heavy Duty Wall Hooks, Nail Hook for Hanging Coat, Hat,Towel Robe Hook Rack Wall Mount- Bathroom and Bedroom Hooks for Wall Without Drilling (Nail Hook Trasparent 10 Pack),4.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality. But price is high for such products where these types of products actually made of interest Rs 1.00 /- even we include all the travel, package, promotion, retail margin etc etc...that should be Rs. 4 - Rs 5 /- per peace or even less.

Price is a big Factor. Otherwise product is good.

,Khaja Moyenudeen
Panasonic 23 L Convection Microwave Oven(NN-CT353BFDG,Black Mirror, 360° Heat Wrap, stainless steel cavity, Magic Grill),4.0 out of 5 stars,Recently we had to replace our Sharp Microwave oven that had given us stellar service for over 15 years. After a detailed comparison of products from multiple manufacturers, we decided to opt for the Panasonic 23L Convection Microwave Oven (model number NN-CT353BFDG). The reason we chose this against the others were the following:

1. We wanted a full function microwave around 21L in size. The functions we needed include grilling, reheating, defrosting, cooking, etc.
2. We wanted a microwave that was able to distribute the heat across the food kept inside.
3. Of course, we wanted one that is priced reasonably.

As I said before, after extensive research, we ordered for the Panasonic. It arrived with a few days of our ordering in spite of the pandemic. After about a month or more of use, here are our observations.

1. The Panasonic fits the requirements we had perfectly.
2. It is at a nice price point. Just around 10K.
3. It works well on whatever tasks we have put it to. It grills, heats, and cooks food perfectly.
4. It does not make to much noise, and the beep it sounds upon completion is what we are used to in Sharp.
5. We were used to have a number keyboard in the Sharp. This does not have it. But it takes only a few moments for us to get used to the new controls in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds.
6. The timer and clock are the same button. To set the time you press the button once. To set the clock, you keep the button pressed for a few seconds and you get the 24H display. You can then set the clock.
7. The Panasonic microwave is a little light in weight. We have kept it atop a rubber mat so that it does not move.
8. Panasonic sent it's engineer the same day the product arrived. He was a little disappointed we had already set the microwave up, and had started using it. But he quickly took a deep breath, and explained the features to us. It is a different matter we knew more about the product then he, as we had read the manual thoroughly a few times.
9. The manual is well written and enough for you to understand how to use the microwave.
10. We are, in general, happy with the choice and have started enjoying using the Panasonic Microwave.

The only issue, if at all any, is that since it does not have a number pad, you can set the timer for say, 17 seconds. It has to be in multiple of 10 seconds. But that is manageable.

,Khaja Moyenudeen
Panasonic 23 L Convection Microwave Oven(NN-CT353BFDG,Black Mirror, 360° Heat Wrap, stainless steel cavity, Magic Grill),4.0 out of 5 stars,Recently we had to replace our Sharp Microwave oven that had given us stellar service for over 15 years. After a detailed comparison of products from multiple manufacturers, we decided to opt for the Panasonic 23L Convection Microwave Oven (model number NN-CT353BFDG). The reason we chose this against the others were the following:

1. We wanted a full function microwave around 21L in size. The functions we needed include grilling, reheating, defrosting, cooking, etc.
2. We wanted a microwave that was able to distribute the heat across the food kept inside.
3. Of course, we wanted one that is priced reasonably.

As I said before, after extensive research, we ordered for the Panasonic. It arrived with a few days of our ordering in spite of the pandemic. After about a month or more of use, here are our observations.

1. The Panasonic fits the requirements we had perfectly.
2. It is at a nice price point. Just around 10K.
3. It works well on whatever tasks we have put it to. It grills, heats, and cooks food perfectly.
4. It does not make to much noise, and the beep it sounds upon completion is what we are used to in Sharp.
5. We were used to have a number keyboard in the Sharp. This does not have it. But it takes only a few moments for us to get used to the new controls in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds.
6. The timer and clock are the same button. To set the time you press the button once. To set the clock, you keep the button pressed for a few seconds and you get the 24H display. You can then set the clock.
7. The Panasonic microwave is a little light in weight. We have kept it atop a rubber mat so that it does not move.
8. Panasonic sent it's engineer the same day the product arrived. He was a little disappointed we had already set the microwave up, and had started using it. But he quickly took a deep breath, and explained the features to us. It is a different matter we knew more about the product then he, as we had read the manual thoroughly a few times.
9. The manual is well written and enough for you to understand how to use the microwave.
10. We are, in general, happy with the choice and have started enjoying using the Panasonic Microwave.

The only issue, if at all any, is that since it does not have a number pad, you can set the timer for say, 17 seconds. It has to be in multiple of 10 seconds. But that is manageable.

Misamo Enterprise PVC Wall Hooks, Pack of 15, Transparent,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased another set of these and I still got no negative feedback. It's a good product and it's perfect for people who live on rent. The process of drilling and having hooks can be lengthy, this saves time and money of course.

These hooks have been a lifesaver in my life at least. I've been using these for a few years and I can say it does what it claims. Yet I must say, these won't hold a lot of weight. If you using these for plants then you must know, that they won't hold their weight for months. Maybe some may but all of them won't. It's not the adhesive that is weak but the hook, it comes off with weight. Maybe you can use it for a smaller plant but not a heavier one. Be careful if you are trying with a heavier pot.

This is good for hanging towels, hand towels especially. I use this behind the bathroom door cus it sticks perfectly on doors. I don't know how strongly it will hold on to a wooden door but it sticks best on titles, plastic kinda doors. Yes, it does stick strongly on walls as well but as long as your wall is perfectly finished.

So anyway, to conclude with. It's perfect to hold light weight stuff.

Good knight Gold Flash Liquid Vapourizer | Mosquito Repellent Refill | Lavender Fragrance | Pack of 4 (45ml each),5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Good Knight Gold Flash Vapourizer for months, and it's super effective against mosquitoes. The lavender fragrance is a nice touch, not too overpowering. Plus, the pack of 4 lasts long, making it great value. Highly recommend for a peaceful, mosquito-free home!

The flash feature seems to be more effective when there’s a sudden increase in mosquitoes. I noticed fewer mosquito bites, even when we keep the windows open for a breeze. It kicks in when you need it most, but it’s not constantly on, so it feels like it’s working smarter, not harder.

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,The rechargeable desk lamp is a true gem for anyone looking for a blend of style, functionality, and convenience. The sleek design fits perfectly on any desk, adding a modern touch without taking up too much space.

What really sets it apart is the rechargeable feature—no more hunting for outlets or dealing with tangled cords. The battery life is impressive, lasting through long work sessions or late-night reading. Plus, the adjustable brightness levels cater to every need, whether you want a soft glow or bright light for detailed tasks. I’m fully impressed

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,My bed side reading companion.
Nice product build, light weight with a functional neck hoist, which is easily adjustable and stays at the needed position. The warm light at low illumination can work as a night lamp too. Easy to use touch control. Illumination better when plugged in but battery support is also fairly good.

Tends to topple and needs some weight in the pencil holder part to stay put.

A recent purchase but have used other products from this company and they are good. Hoping this one betters the experience

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently added WD-40 to my toolbox, and I'm thrilled with its versatility and effectiveness in various applications. Here's why I find this multipurpose spray to be an invaluable asset:

**Multipurpose Marvel:**
WD-40 truly lives up to its reputation as an all-in-one solution. From acting as a rust remover to a stain remover, lubricant, and more, its countless utilities make it a must-have for both home improvement and automotive purposes.

**Multi-Surface Magic:**
What sets WD-40 apart is its ability to seamlessly work on various surfaces. Whether it's metal, iron, chrome, wood, aluminum, or more, this spray proves its efficacy across a multitude of materials. It has become my go-to solution, not just at home but also for my vehicle and other commercial uses.

**Excellent Lubrication:**
For lubrication needs, WD-40 is unmatched. It has proven to be an excellent choice for ensuring smooth functioning of drawer channels, door hinges, sewing machines, and cycle chains. Its unique formula provides effective lubrication without causing any external damage to these surfaces.

**Powerful Degreasing Agent:**
The spray's prowess extends to effective degreasing. It effortlessly removes grime, grease, and smudges from various surfaces, including wooden tables, countertops, and metallic surfaces of vehicles. This quality makes it a reliable degreasing agent for a variety of applications.

**Active Cleaning Agent:**
WD-40 is not just a lubricant and degreaser; it's also a formidable cleaning agent. It excels at removing stains, dirt, sticky residues, and dust particles. I've witnessed its effectiveness on automobile parts, cleaning spark plugs, and restoring the shine to rusting showpieces.

**Personal Satisfaction:**
My personal experience with WD-40 has been extremely satisfying, particularly in cleaning my vehicle's chain. It brought back the gleam, making it look as good as new. The ease of use and the wide range of applications have made it an indispensable part of my maintenance routine.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, WD-40 has proven to be a game-changer in home and auto care. Its multipurpose functionality, compatibility with various surfaces, and effectiveness in lubrication, degreasing, and cleaning make it an essential tool for DIY enthusiasts and professionals alike. I highly recommend WD-40 for anyone seeking a reliable, all-in-one solution for their maintenance needs.

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,I had a couple of Godrej locks whuch got rusted and thus become unusable as they were exposed to rainwater. Though these locks were expensive, I was planning to discard it. Then I decided to take a chance and ordered WD-40. It WORKED beautifully. The locks got loosened, almost miraculously! It does not work immediately after spraying. It does not seem to be a lubricant. I sprayed the locks with WD-40 and left them for 10 hours, and then tried to unlock them, it got UNLICKED, as if new! I recommend it.

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,You can not miss this to have it if you own a car. This thing of a piece works like magic for me. I had so many scratches on my new car and I was very afraid that I might get those parts repainted. I was literally thought of filing a claim as well for those scratches. The one i have attached in media is the smallest one there were many more worse than this.
I bought this with no expectations and very surprised by the results i got. Almost 80-90% of the scratches were removed completely when rubbed well with a microfiber cloth.
If you have scratches on your car, do not doubt a bit and go ahead with this one.

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently added WD-40 to my toolbox, and I'm thrilled with its versatility and effectiveness in various applications. Here's why I find this multipurpose spray to be an invaluable asset:

**Multipurpose Marvel:**
WD-40 truly lives up to its reputation as an all-in-one solution. From acting as a rust remover to a stain remover, lubricant, and more, its countless utilities make it a must-have for both home improvement and automotive purposes.

**Multi-Surface Magic:**
What sets WD-40 apart is its ability to seamlessly work on various surfaces. Whether it's metal, iron, chrome, wood, aluminum, or more, this spray proves its efficacy across a multitude of materials. It has become my go-to solution, not just at home but also for my vehicle and other commercial uses.

**Excellent Lubrication:**
For lubrication needs, WD-40 is unmatched. It has proven to be an excellent choice for ensuring smooth functioning of drawer channels, door hinges, sewing machines, and cycle chains. Its unique formula provides effective lubrication without causing any external damage to these surfaces.

**Powerful Degreasing Agent:**
The spray's prowess extends to effective degreasing. It effortlessly removes grime, grease, and smudges from various surfaces, including wooden tables, countertops, and metallic surfaces of vehicles. This quality makes it a reliable degreasing agent for a variety of applications.

**Active Cleaning Agent:**
WD-40 is not just a lubricant and degreaser; it's also a formidable cleaning agent. It excels at removing stains, dirt, sticky residues, and dust particles. I've witnessed its effectiveness on automobile parts, cleaning spark plugs, and restoring the shine to rusting showpieces.

**Personal Satisfaction:**
My personal experience with WD-40 has been extremely satisfying, particularly in cleaning my vehicle's chain. It brought back the gleam, making it look as good as new. The ease of use and the wide range of applications have made it an indispensable part of my maintenance routine.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, WD-40 has proven to be a game-changer in home and auto care. Its multipurpose functionality, compatibility with various surfaces, and effectiveness in lubrication, degreasing, and cleaning make it an essential tool for DIY enthusiasts and professionals alike. I highly recommend WD-40 for anyone seeking a reliable, all-in-one solution for their maintenance needs.

I ordered silver gray. The size is 56×86 not 60×90. They should follow the standard measurements.
It is very warm enough and quickly in healy winter. If you can consider little bit small size against the very soft and good quality fiber than go for it.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,5.0 out of 5 stars,That sounds like a great product! I recently purchased bamboo tissues, and I am thoroughly impressed with their quality. Unlike regular paper tissues, these bamboo tissues are incredibly soft and durable. One of the standout features is that a single tissue lasts much longer, reducing waste significantly. This makes them not only a more sustainable choice but also a cost-effective one. I highly recommend these bamboo tissues for anyone looking for a soft, eco-friendly alternative to paper tissues.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,4.0 out of 5 stars,To start, this product's packaging is minimal and crafted from recycled materials, showcasing the company's dedication to sustainability. The tissues themselves are created from 100% natural bamboo, a highly renewable resource that is more environmentally conscious than traditional wood pulp.

Upon my initial use of the tissues, I was pleasantly surprised by their softness and gentle touch on my skin. Often, eco-friendly products can be abrasive and rough, but these tissues are luxuriously soft. Moreover, they possess a 2-ply design, making them sturdy and long-lasting. In the past, I have used other environmentally friendly tissues that easily tore or disintegrated, but these hold up well and leave no residue.

I am also thrilled that this pack contains 100 pulls per box, eliminating the need for frequent restocking. Furthermore, with a pack of 6, I have an ample supply of tissues to last me a considerable amount of time.

What I appreciate most about these tissues is that they are not only beneficial to the environment, but they are also beneficial to my skin. As someone with sensitive skin, I often react to harsh chemicals and fragrances, but these tissues contain no harmful additives.

Overall, I highly recommend the Beco Bamboo Super Soft Facial Tissue for anyone seeking a sustainable and gentle solution for their facial tissue needs. It is a small change that can have a significant impact on the environment, and it is a product that I will continue to purchase in the future.

NEWISH Pepper Spray for self Defence Small Pocket Size - Reliable and Effective Self-Defense 50 Time Spray,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this Red Cop Pepper Spray for self defence after reading some positive reviews on Amazon. I was looking for effective spray that could protect me from thieves and criminals at night. I have to say that this product has exceeded my expectations.

The spray is very easy to use and has a good range of about upto 15 feet. The nozzle always points towards the attacker's face, which ensures accuracy and prevents accidental spraying.

The spray is also very handy and can be placed anywhere, with just little space allocation. I usually carry it in my pocket, and sometimes in my bag. The spray is legal to use. I felt very safe and confident with this spray.

Overall, I am very satisfied with this Red Cop Pepper spray for self defence. It is a powerful and affordable product that gives me peace of mind and security. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to protect themselves from harm.

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),5.0 out of 5 stars,** First Impression **
● The shuttle is yellow in colour with green band at the base. The shuttle base is cork with nylon covering and the skirts are also nylon
● This comes in a carton tube with 6 shuttles packed. The carton has holograms
● The shuttles are manufactured in Japan and is imported by Sunrise Sports

** Product Verification **
● A lot of reviews here say that they think they have got a counterfeit product. You can verify your purchase at Yonex website using the serial number
● The serial number can be revealed by scratching the hologram label. Goto the website 'sunrisetnt' and enter this code there; it's case-sensitive. The site will tell you whether your purchase is genuine or not

** Performance **
● I am an amateur and play on outdoor clay court
● I play with green cap, which is slower in comparison with other caps. However after one or two games, the difference in behaviour disappears
● The recovery of shuttle after the shot is very fast and a problem with this has never been experienced or noted during the play
● The performance in flight path is also not something that gets noticed or influencing while playing badminton as an amateur
● I have been mostly using 350 and a shuttle lasts for around 10 to 15 games before it starts showing signs of disintegration. I replace the shuttle when the first crack appears on the skirt

** Major Differences between popular Shuttlecocks **
● Mavis 10
- Mavis 10 has a nylon base, other shuttles compared here have cork base. So, this lasts longer and best suited for practise sessions
- The flight performance has the least resemblance to feather shuttles. So if you practise for tournaments, I suggest not to use this. If you are a beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is a good choice
● Mavis 300 & 350
- Both these have cork base and nylon feathers
- These shuttles are a tad slower than Mavis 10 and behaviour is closer to feather shuttles in performance when compared with 10
- If you are an amateur who is serious about badminton, this is the best shuttles for you to purchase
- Most of the badminton trainers and coaching centers use either 300 or 350
- I could not experience any difference between 300 and 350, but many people think 350 is better in terms of flight path and durability and my choice of shuttles are 350
● Mavis 500
- This has got cork base and nylon feathers
- These are closer to feather shuttles in terms of flight behaviour & feel than 300/350 and the rate at which it slows down is faster. These shuttles provide more precision & control, and obviously are costlier
- Having said all these, you may not be able to spot much difference even if you are an advanced amateur. However, I have observed that the skirt starts cracking quicker than 350
● Mavis 2000
- This has got the best flight behaviour of all the above and is mostly used for tournaments if feather shuttle is not used. These shuttles are light and the speed & sturdiness are the closest to feather shuttles
● Feather Shuttles
- Nylon shuttlecocks can never match the flight behaviour of feather shuttles. If you want to gain clear control, feel, touch and master different strokes, you have to play on feather shuttles
- One of the major differences in behaviour with nylon shuttles is the dramatic slowing down of feather shuttles. Professionals and serious badminton players use feather shuttles that helps them gain superior techniques and precision control
● Cap Colour
- The colours on cap indicate the speed of the shuttle. When the climate is hot, the air resistance will be less thus making the shuttle travel faster than in cold conditions. This is compensated by using slower shuttles in hot conditions and faster shuttles in cold conditions
- Green cap is the slowest shuttle. You have to put in more power to push the shuttle to the back of the court. This is more suitable for hot and humid weather or at high altitudes
- Blue cap shuttles have medium speed and is most suited for areas where temperature is around 20 degrees
- Red is the fastest of the three and is best for temperatures around 10 degrees and at low altitudes where the air is denser
- I live in Kerala and I normally pick the green cap
● Shuttle Colour
- Colour of shuttle does not have any significance. Yellow shuttles have got more visibility over the white ones

** Summary **
● All these shuttles look almost the same. The main physical difference you can see is the size of holes in the mesh on the shuttle skirt. There are other differences in the cap material, weight of the cap, etc. that determines the behaviour of the shuttle
● If you are an amateur beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is enough which is cheaper and have the most life
● 300 or 350 is best suited if you are amateur but a serious gamer. I don't really know the difference between 300 and 350, but many people say 350 is a better one
● 500 is recommended if you want to experience shuttle behaviour closer to feathers as an amateur
● 2000 is recommended for aspiring professionals incase you don't have the luxury to practise with feathers
● Having said all these, I have to disclaim that this is from my own experience of playing the game and other players I have spoken with have different opinions, especially on the difference between 300, 350 and 500.

● The shuttle is yellow in colour with green band at the base. The shuttle base is cork with nylon covering and the skirts are also nylon
● This comes in a carton tube with 6 shuttles packed. The carton has holograms
● The shuttles are manufactured in Japan and is imported by Sunrise Sports

** Product Verification **
● A lot of reviews here say that they think they have got a counterfeit product. You can verify your purchase at Yonex website using the serial number
● The serial number can be revealed by scratching the hologram label. Goto the website 'sunrisetnt' and enter this code there; it's case-sensitive. The site will tell you whether your purchase is genuine or not

** Performance **
● I am an amateur and play on outdoor clay court
● I play with green cap, which is slower in comparison with other caps. However after one or two games, the difference in behaviour disappears
● The recovery of shuttle after the shot is very fast and a problem with this has never been experienced or noted during the play
● The performance in flight path is also not something that gets noticed or influencing while playing badminton as an amateur
● I have been mostly using 350 and a shuttle lasts for around 10 to 15 games before it starts showing signs of disintegration. I replace the shuttle when the first crack appears on the skirt

** Major Differences between popular Shuttlecocks **
● Mavis 10
- Mavis 10 has a nylon base, other shuttles compared here have cork base. So, this lasts longer and best suited for practise sessions
- The flight performance has the least resemblance to feather shuttles. So if you practise for tournaments, I suggest not to use this. If you are a beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is a good choice
● Mavis 300 & 350
- Both these have cork base and nylon feathers
- These shuttles are a tad slower than Mavis 10 and behaviour is closer to feather shuttles in performance when compared with 10
- If you are an amateur who is serious about badminton, this is the best shuttles for you to purchase
- Most of the badminton trainers and coaching centers use either 300 or 350
- I could not experience any difference between 300 and 350, but many people think 350 is better in terms of flight path and durability and my choice of shuttles are 350
● Mavis 500
- This has got cork base and nylon feathers
- These are closer to feather shuttles in terms of flight behaviour & feel than 300/350 and the rate at which it slows down is faster. These shuttles provide more precision & control, and obviously are costlier
- Having said all these, you may not be able to spot much difference even if you are an advanced amateur. However, I have observed that the skirt starts cracking quicker than 350
● Mavis 2000
- This has got the best flight behaviour of all the above and is mostly used for tournaments if feather shuttle is not used. These shuttles are light and the speed & sturdiness are the closest to feather shuttles
● Feather Shuttles
- Nylon shuttlecocks can never match the flight behaviour of feather shuttles. If you want to gain clear control, feel, touch and master different strokes, you have to play on feather shuttles
- One of the major differences in behaviour with nylon shuttles is the dramatic slowing down of feather shuttles. Professionals and serious badminton players use feather shuttles that helps them gain superior techniques and precision control
● Cap Colour
- The colours on cap indicate the speed of the shuttle. When the climate is hot, the air resistance will be less thus making the shuttle travel faster than in cold conditions. This is compensated by using slower shuttles in hot conditions and faster shuttles in cold conditions
- Green cap is the slowest shuttle. You have to put in more power to push the shuttle to the back of the court. This is more suitable for hot and humid weather or at high altitudes
- Blue cap shuttles have medium speed and is most suited for areas where temperature is around 20 degrees
- Red is the fastest of the three and is best for temperatures around 10 degrees and at low altitudes where the air is denser
- I live in Kerala and I normally pick the green cap
● Shuttle Colour
- Colour of shuttle does not have any significance. Yellow shuttles have got more visibility over the white ones

** Summary **
● All these shuttles look almost the same. The main physical difference you can see is the size of holes in the mesh on the shuttle skirt. There are other differences in the cap material, weight of the cap, etc. that determines the behaviour of the shuttle
● If you are an amateur beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is enough which is cheaper and have the most life
● 300 or 350 is best suited if you are amateur but a serious gamer. I don't really know the difference between 300 and 350, but many people say 350 is a better one
● 500 is recommended if you want to experience shuttle behaviour closer to feathers as an amateur
● 2000 is recommended for aspiring professionals incase you don't have the luxury to practise with feathers
● Having said all these, I have to disclaim that this is from my own experience of playing the game and other players I have spoken with have different opinions, especially on the difference between 300, 350 and 500.

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),5.0 out of 5 stars,Never ever play in rain with the shuttle or near water if it gets wet it will loose its adhesive.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic, and my experience has been somewhat mixed.

First, the positives: The scale is indeed portable and compact, making it easy to store in my kitchen drawer without taking up too much space. It's lightweight, which adds to its portability, and the design is sleek and modern, which fits well with my kitchen decor. The digital display is clear and easy to read, and the scale is user-friendly with simple controls.

However, there are several drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. The accuracy of the scale is quite disappointing, with a margin of error of about ±3 grams. For precise measurements, especially in baking or other culinary activities where accuracy is crucial, this can be quite problematic. I found myself needing to double-check measurements with another scale to ensure accuracy.

Additionally, the material quality leaves much to be desired. The scale is made of low-quality plastic, which feels flimsy and not particularly durable. I'm concerned about its longevity, especially with regular use in a busy kitchen environment. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will last very long without developing cracks or other signs of wear and tear.

In summary, while the beatXP Kitchen Scale has some convenient features and an attractive design, its lack of accuracy and low-quality materials are significant downsides. If precision and durability are important to you, you might want to consider other options on the market.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,The beatXP Kitchen Scale KS106 is an adequate product for its price. It's a basic kitchen scale that does the job, but it doesn't exceed expectations. The scale offers decent accuracy and is easy to use, making it a practical choice for those on a budget. However, the build quality and features are quite basic, which is understandable given its low cost.

If you're looking for something that just works without any bells and whistles, this scale fits the bill. But if you require more precision or durability, you might want to consider investing in a higher-end model. Overall, it's an okay product that delivers fair value for its cost.

In summary, while the beatXP Kitchen Scale has some convenient features and an attractive design, its lack of accuracy and low-quality materials are significant downsides. If precision and durability are important to you, you might want to consider other options on the market.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,The beatXP Kitchen Scale KS106 is an adequate product for its price. It's a basic kitchen scale that does the job, but it doesn't exceed expectations. The scale offers decent accuracy and is easy to use, making it a practical choice for those on a budget. However, the build quality and features are quite basic, which is understandable given its low cost.

If you're looking for something that just works without any bells and whistles, this scale fits the bill. But if you require more precision or durability, you might want to consider investing in a higher-end model. Overall, it's an okay product that delivers fair value for its cost.

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,5.0 out of 5 stars,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I cannot express how thrilled I am with my recent purchase of the Amazon basics Egg Boiler! This little appliance has truly transformed my mornings and simplified my meal prep routine.

First and foremost, let's talk about efficiency. This egg boiler is lightning-fast, delivering perfectly cooked eggs in a matter of minutes. Whether I'm craving a soft-boiled egg with a gooey center or a firm hard-boiled egg for my salads, this device consistently delivers flawless results every single time.

The simplicity of operation is another standout feature. With just a push of a button, I can select my desired level of doneness and let the egg boiler work its magic. No more hovering over a pot of boiling water, hoping for consistent results. This device takes the guesswork out of egg cooking, which is a game-changer for busy mornings.

Clean-up is a breeze with the removable parts being dishwasher-safe, saving me precious time and effort. The compact design also makes storage a non-issue, fitting perfectly in my kitchen cabinet without taking up too much space.

Additionally, I appreciate the thoughtful design elements incorporated into this egg boiler. The automatic shut-off feature ensures safety and prevents overcooking, giving me peace of mind while multitasking in the kitchen.

Overall, the Amazon basics Egg Boiler has exceeded my expectations in every aspect. It's reliable, efficient, and incredibly easy to use. If you're looking to streamline your breakfast routine and achieve consistently perfect eggs, look no further than this fantastic appliance. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable egg-cooking solution.

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a good product. Before this gas stove was used in my home. Near about 20 minutes of waste LPG gas for boilling the egg. But, this product takes only 5> to <10 minutes to boil the 7 eggs together.
But, this has 3 draw back.
1) After autoshut the boiler. If I forget to switch off the plug, after some times the boiler gets auto on.
2) Unable to make half-boil eggs with this product, even folloing the instruction to the letter.
3) Unable to crack the top of the eggs as instructed. Egg shell is very tough, it's not easy to drill. So much force and the eggs will shattered.

,Khaja Moyenudeen
Panasonic 23 L Convection Microwave Oven(NN-CT353BFDG,Black Mirror, 360° Heat Wrap, stainless steel cavity, Magic Grill),4.0 out of 5 stars,Recently we had to replace our Sharp Microwave oven that had given us stellar service for over 15 years. After a detailed comparison of products from multiple manufacturers, we decided to opt for the Panasonic 23L Convection Microwave Oven (model number NN-CT353BFDG). The reason we chose this against the others were the following:

1. We wanted a full function microwave around 21L in size. The functions we needed include grilling, reheating, defrosting, cooking, etc.
2. We wanted a microwave that was able to distribute the heat across the food kept inside.
3. Of course, we wanted one that is priced reasonably.

As I said before, after extensive research, we ordered for the Panasonic. It arrived with a few days of our ordering in spite of the pandemic. After about a month or more of use, here are our observations.

1. The Panasonic fits the requirements we had perfectly.
2. It is at a nice price point. Just around 10K.
3. It works well on whatever tasks we have put it to. It grills, heats, and cooks food perfectly.
4. It does not make to much noise, and the beep it sounds upon completion is what we are used to in Sharp.
5. We were used to have a number keyboard in the Sharp. This does not have it. But it takes only a few moments for us to get used to the new controls in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds.
6. The timer and clock are the same button. To set the time you press the button once. To set the clock, you keep the button pressed for a few seconds and you get the 24H display. You can then set the clock.
7. The Panasonic microwave is a little light in weight. We have kept it atop a rubber mat so that it does not move.
8. Panasonic sent it's engineer the same day the product arrived. He was a little disappointed we had already set the microwave up, and had started using it. But he quickly took a deep breath, and explained the features to us. It is a different matter we knew more about the product then he, as we had read the manual thoroughly a few times.
9. The manual is well written and enough for you to understand how to use the microwave.
10. We are, in general, happy with the choice and have started enjoying using the Panasonic Microwave.

The only issue, if at all any, is that since it does not have a number pad, you can set the timer for say, 17 seconds. It has to be in multiple of 10 seconds. But that is manageable.

,Khaja Moyenudeen
Panasonic 23 L Convection Microwave Oven(NN-CT353BFDG,Black Mirror, 360° Heat Wrap, stainless steel cavity, Magic Grill),4.0 out of 5 stars,Recently we had to replace our Sharp Microwave oven that had given us stellar service for over 15 years. After a detailed comparison of products from multiple manufacturers, we decided to opt for the Panasonic 23L Convection Microwave Oven (model number NN-CT353BFDG). The reason we chose this against the others were the following:

1. We wanted a full function microwave around 21L in size. The functions we needed include grilling, reheating, defrosting, cooking, etc.
2. We wanted a microwave that was able to distribute the heat across the food kept inside.
3. Of course, we wanted one that is priced reasonably.

As I said before, after extensive research, we ordered for the Panasonic. It arrived with a few days of our ordering in spite of the pandemic. After about a month or more of use, here are our observations.

1. The Panasonic fits the requirements we had perfectly.
2. It is at a nice price point. Just around 10K.
3. It works well on whatever tasks we have put it to. It grills, heats, and cooks food perfectly.
4. It does not make to much noise, and the beep it sounds upon completion is what we are used to in Sharp.
5. We were used to have a number keyboard in the Sharp. This does not have it. But it takes only a few moments for us to get used to the new controls in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds.
6. The timer and clock are the same button. To set the time you press the button once. To set the clock, you keep the button pressed for a few seconds and you get the 24H display. You can then set the clock.
7. The Panasonic microwave is a little light in weight. We have kept it atop a rubber mat so that it does not move.
8. Panasonic sent it's engineer the same day the product arrived. He was a little disappointed we had already set the microwave up, and had started using it. But he quickly took a deep breath, and explained the features to us. It is a different matter we knew more about the product then he, as we had read the manual thoroughly a few times.
9. The manual is well written and enough for you to understand how to use the microwave.
10. We are, in general, happy with the choice and have started enjoying using the Panasonic Microwave.

The only issue, if at all any, is that since it does not have a number pad, you can set the timer for say, 17 seconds. It has to be in multiple of 10 seconds. But that is manageable.

Misamo Enterprise PVC Wall Hooks, Pack of 15, Transparent,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased another set of these and I still got no negative feedback. It's a good product and it's perfect for people who live on rent. The process of drilling and having hooks can be lengthy, this saves time and money of course.

These hooks have been a lifesaver in my life at least. I've been using these for a few years and I can say it does what it claims. Yet I must say, these won't hold a lot of weight. If you using these for plants then you must know, that they won't hold their weight for months. Maybe some may but all of them won't. It's not the adhesive that is weak but the hook, it comes off with weight. Maybe you can use it for a smaller plant but not a heavier one. Be careful if you are trying with a heavier pot.

This is good for hanging towels, hand towels especially. I use this behind the bathroom door cus it sticks perfectly on doors. I don't know how strongly it will hold on to a wooden door but it sticks best on titles, plastic kinda doors. Yes, it does stick strongly on walls as well but as long as your wall is perfectly finished.

So anyway, to conclude with. It's perfect to hold light weight stuff.

Good knight Gold Flash Liquid Vapourizer | Mosquito Repellent Refill | Lavender Fragrance | Pack of 4 (45ml each),5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Good Knight Gold Flash Vapourizer for months, and it's super effective against mosquitoes. The lavender fragrance is a nice touch, not too overpowering. Plus, the pack of 4 lasts long, making it great value. Highly recommend for a peaceful, mosquito-free home!

The flash feature seems to be more effective when there’s a sudden increase in mosquitoes. I noticed fewer mosquito bites, even when we keep the windows open for a breeze. It kicks in when you need it most, but it’s not constantly on, so it feels like it’s working smarter, not harder.

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,The rechargeable desk lamp is a true gem for anyone looking for a blend of style, functionality, and convenience. The sleek design fits perfectly on any desk, adding a modern touch without taking up too much space.

What really sets it apart is the rechargeable feature—no more hunting for outlets or dealing with tangled cords. The battery life is impressive, lasting through long work sessions or late-night reading. Plus, the adjustable brightness levels cater to every need, whether you want a soft glow or bright light for detailed tasks. I’m fully impressed

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,My bed side reading companion.
Nice product build, light weight with a functional neck hoist, which is easily adjustable and stays at the needed position. The warm light at low illumination can work as a night lamp too. Easy to use touch control. Illumination better when plugged in but battery support is also fairly good.

Tends to topple and needs some weight in the pencil holder part to stay put.

A recent purchase but have used other products from this company and they are good. Hoping this one betters the experience

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently added WD-40 to my toolbox, and I'm thrilled with its versatility and effectiveness in various applications. Here's why I find this multipurpose spray to be an invaluable asset:

**Multipurpose Marvel:**
WD-40 truly lives up to its reputation as an all-in-one solution. From acting as a rust remover to a stain remover, lubricant, and more, its countless utilities make it a must-have for both home improvement and automotive purposes.

**Multi-Surface Magic:**
What sets WD-40 apart is its ability to seamlessly work on various surfaces. Whether it's metal, iron, chrome, wood, aluminum, or more, this spray proves its efficacy across a multitude of materials. It has become my go-to solution, not just at home but also for my vehicle and other commercial uses.

**Excellent Lubrication:**
For lubrication needs, WD-40 is unmatched. It has proven to be an excellent choice for ensuring smooth functioning of drawer channels, door hinges, sewing machines, and cycle chains. Its unique formula provides effective lubrication without causing any external damage to these surfaces.

**Powerful Degreasing Agent:**
The spray's prowess extends to effective degreasing. It effortlessly removes grime, grease, and smudges from various surfaces, including wooden tables, countertops, and metallic surfaces of vehicles. This quality makes it a reliable degreasing agent for a variety of applications.

**Active Cleaning Agent:**
WD-40 is not just a lubricant and degreaser; it's also a formidable cleaning agent. It excels at removing stains, dirt, sticky residues, and dust particles. I've witnessed its effectiveness on automobile parts, cleaning spark plugs, and restoring the shine to rusting showpieces.

**Personal Satisfaction:**
My personal experience with WD-40 has been extremely satisfying, particularly in cleaning my vehicle's chain. It brought back the gleam, making it look as good as new. The ease of use and the wide range of applications have made it an indispensable part of my maintenance routine.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, WD-40 has proven to be a game-changer in home and auto care. Its multipurpose functionality, compatibility with various surfaces, and effectiveness in lubrication, degreasing, and cleaning make it an essential tool for DIY enthusiasts and professionals alike. I highly recommend WD-40 for anyone seeking a reliable, all-in-one solution for their maintenance needs.

Though these locks were expensive, I was planning to discard it. Then I decided to take a chance and ordered WD-40. It WORKED beautifully. The locks got loosened, almost miraculously! It does not work immediately after spraying. It does not seem to be a lubricant. I sprayed the locks with WD-40 and left them for 10 hours, and then tried to unlock them, it got UNLICKED, as if new! I recommend it.

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,You can not miss this to have it if you own a car. This thing of a piece works like magic for me. I had so many scratches on my new car and I was very afraid that I might get those parts repainted. I was literally thought of filing a claim as well for those scratches. The one i have attached in media is the smallest one there were many more worse than this.
I bought this with no expectations and very surprised by the results i got. Almost 80-90% of the scratches were removed completely when rubbed well with a microfiber cloth.
If you have scratches on your car, do not doubt a bit and go ahead with this one.

Here's why I find this multipurpose spray to be an invaluable asset:

**Multipurpose Marvel:**
WD-40 truly lives up to its reputation as an all-in-one solution. From acting as a rust remover to a stain remover, lubricant, and more, its countless utilities make it a must-have for both home improvement and automotive purposes.

What sets WD-40 apart is its ability to seamlessly work on various surfaces. Whether it's metal, iron, chrome, wood, aluminum, or more, this spray proves its efficacy across a multitude of materials. It has become my go-to solution, not just at home but also for my vehicle and other commercial uses.

**Excellent Lubrication:**
For lubrication needs, WD-40 is unmatched. It has proven to be an excellent choice for ensuring smooth functioning of drawer channels, door hinges, sewing machines, and cycle chains. Its unique formula provides effective lubrication without causing any external damage to these surfaces.

The spray's prowess extends to effective degreasing. It effortlessly removes grime, grease, and smudges from various surfaces, including wooden tables, countertops, and metallic surfaces of vehicles. This quality makes it a reliable degreasing agent for a variety of applications.

WD-40 is not just a lubricant and degreaser; it's also a formidable cleaning agent. It excels at removing stains, dirt, sticky residues, and dust particles. I've witnessed its effectiveness on automobile parts, cleaning spark plugs, and restoring the shine to rusting showpieces.

**Personal Satisfaction:**
My personal experience with WD-40 has been extremely satisfying, particularly in cleaning my vehicle's chain. It brought back the gleam, making it look as good as new. The ease of use and the wide range of applications have made it an indispensable part of my maintenance routine.

In conclusion, WD-40 has proven to be a game-changer in home and auto care.

I ordered silver gray. The size is 56×86 not 60×90. They should follow the standard measurements.
It is very warm enough and quickly in healy winter. If you can consider little bit small size against the very soft and good quality fiber than go for it.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,5.0 out of 5 stars,That sounds like a great product! I recently purchased bamboo tissues, and I am thoroughly impressed with their quality. Unlike regular paper tissues, these bamboo tissues are incredibly soft and durable. One of the standout features is that a single tissue lasts much longer, reducing waste significantly. This makes them not only a more sustainable choice but also a cost-effective one. I highly recommend these bamboo tissues for anyone looking for a soft, eco-friendly alternative to paper tissues.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,4.0 out of 5 stars,To start, this product's packaging is minimal and crafted from recycled materials, showcasing the company's dedication to sustainability. The tissues themselves are created from 100% natural bamboo, a highly renewable resource that is more environmentally conscious than traditional wood pulp.

Upon my initial use of the tissues, I was pleasantly surprised by their softness and gentle touch on my skin. Often, eco-friendly products can be abrasive and rough, but these tissues are luxuriously soft. Moreover, they possess a 2-ply design, making them sturdy and long-lasting. In the past, I have used other environmentally friendly tissues that easily tore or disintegrated, but these hold up well and leave no residue.

I am also thrilled that this pack contains 100 pulls per box, eliminating the need for frequent restocking. Furthermore, with a pack of 6, I have an ample supply of tissues to last me a considerable amount of time.

What I appreciate most about these tissues is that they are not only beneficial to the environment, but they are also beneficial to my skin. As someone with sensitive skin, I often react to harsh chemicals and fragrances, but these tissues contain no harmful additives.

Overall, I highly recommend the Beco Bamboo Super Soft Facial Tissue for anyone seeking a sustainable and gentle solution for their facial tissue needs. It is a small change that can have a significant impact on the environment, and it is a product that I will continue to purchase in the future.

NEWISH Pepper Spray for self Defence Small Pocket Size - Reliable and Effective Self-Defense 50 Time Spray,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this Red Cop Pepper Spray for self defence after reading some positive reviews on Amazon. I was looking for effective spray that could protect me from thieves and criminals at night. I have to say that this product has exceeded my expectations.

The spray is very easy to use and has a good range of about upto 15 feet. The nozzle always points towards the attacker's face, which ensures accuracy and prevents accidental spraying.

The spray is also very handy and can be placed anywhere, with just little space allocation. I usually carry it in my pocket, and sometimes in my bag. The spray is legal to use. I felt very safe and confident with this spray.

Overall, I am very satisfied with this Red Cop Pepper spray for self defence. It is a powerful and affordable product that gives me peace of mind and security. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to protect themselves from harm.

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),5.0 out of 5 stars,** First Impression **
● The shuttle is yellow in colour with green band at the base. The shuttle base is cork with nylon covering and the skirts are also nylon
● This comes in a carton tube with 6 shuttles packed. The carton has holograms
● The shuttles are manufactured in Japan and is imported by Sunrise Sports

** Product Verification **
● A lot of reviews here say that they think they have got a counterfeit product. You can verify your purchase at Yonex website using the serial number
● The serial number can be revealed by scratching the hologram label. Goto the website 'sunrisetnt' and enter this code there; it's case-sensitive. The site will tell you whether your purchase is genuine or not

** Performance **
● I am an amateur and play on outdoor clay court
● I play with green cap, which is slower in comparison with other caps. However after one or two games, the difference in behaviour disappears
● The recovery of shuttle after the shot is very fast and a problem with this has never been experienced or noted during the play
● The performance in flight path is also not something that gets noticed or influencing while playing badminton as an amateur
● I have been mostly using 350 and a shuttle lasts for around 10 to 15 games before it starts showing signs of disintegration. I replace the shuttle when the first crack appears on the skirt

** Major Differences between popular Shuttlecocks **
● Mavis 10
- Mavis 10 has a nylon base, other shuttles compared here have cork base. So, this lasts longer and best suited for practise sessions
- The flight performance has the least resemblance to feather shuttles. So if you practise for tournaments, I suggest not to use this. If you are a beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is a good choice
● Mavis 300 & 350
- Both these have cork base and nylon feathers
- These shuttles are a tad slower than Mavis 10 and behaviour is closer to feather shuttles in performance when compared with 10
- If you are an amateur who is serious about badminton, this is the best shuttles for you to purchase
- Most of the badminton trainers and coaching centers use either 300 or 350
- I could not experience any difference between 300 and 350, but many people think 350 is better in terms of flight path and durability and my choice of shuttles are 350
● Mavis 500
- This has got cork base and nylon feathers
- These are closer to feather shuttles in terms of flight behaviour & feel than 300/350 and the rate at which it slows down is faster. These shuttles provide more precision & control, and obviously are costlier
- Having said all these, you may not be able to spot much difference even if you are an advanced amateur. However, I have observed that the skirt starts cracking quicker than 350
● Mavis 2000
- This has got the best flight behaviour of all the above and is mostly used for tournaments if feather shuttle is not used. These shuttles are light and the speed & sturdiness are the closest to feather shuttles
● Feather Shuttles
- Nylon shuttlecocks can never match the flight behaviour of feather shuttles. If you want to gain clear control, feel, touch and master different strokes, you have to play on feather shuttles
- One of the major differences in behaviour with nylon shuttles is the dramatic slowing down of feather shuttles. Professionals and serious badminton players use feather shuttles that helps them gain superior techniques and precision control
● Cap Colour
- The colours on cap indicate the speed of the shuttle. When the climate is hot, the air resistance will be less thus making the shuttle travel faster than in cold conditions. This is compensated by using slower shuttles in hot conditions and faster shuttles in cold conditions
- Green cap is the slowest shuttle. You have to put in more power to push the shuttle to the back of the court. This is more suitable for hot and humid weather or at high altitudes
- Blue cap shuttles have medium speed and is most suited for areas where temperature is around 20 degrees
- Red is the fastest of the three and is best for temperatures around 10 degrees and at low altitudes where the air is denser
- I live in Kerala and I normally pick the green cap
● Shuttle Colour
- Colour of shuttle does not have any significance. Yellow shuttles have got more visibility over the white ones

** Summary **
● All these shuttles look almost the same. The main physical difference you can see is the size of holes in the mesh on the shuttle skirt. There are other differences in the cap material, weight of the cap, etc. that determines the behaviour of the shuttle
● If you are an amateur beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is enough which is cheaper and have the most life
● 300 or 350 is best suited if you are amateur but a serious gamer. I don't really know the difference between 300 and 350, but many people say 350 is a better one
● 500 is recommended if you want to experience shuttle behaviour closer to feathers as an amateur
● 2000 is recommended for aspiring professionals incase you don't have the luxury to practise with feathers
● Having said all these, I have to disclaim that this is from my own experience of playing the game and other players I have spoken with have different opinions, especially on the difference between 300, 350 and 500.

● The shuttle is yellow in colour with green band at the base. The shuttle base is cork with nylon covering and the skirts are also nylon
● This comes in a carton tube with 6 shuttles packed. The carton has holograms
● The shuttles are manufactured in Japan and is imported by Sunrise Sports

** Product Verification **
● A lot of reviews here say that they think they have got a counterfeit product. You can verify your purchase at Yonex website using the serial number
● The serial number can be revealed by scratching the hologram label. Goto the website 'sunrisetnt' and enter this code there; it's case-sensitive. The site will tell you whether your purchase is genuine or not

** Performance **
● I am an amateur and play on outdoor clay court
● I play with green cap, which is slower in comparison with other caps. However after one or two games, the difference in behaviour disappears
● The recovery of shuttle after the shot is very fast and a problem with this has never been experienced or noted during the play
● The performance in flight path is also not something that gets noticed or influencing while playing badminton as an amateur
● I have been mostly using 350 and a shuttle lasts for around 10 to 15 games before it starts showing signs of disintegration. I replace the shuttle when the first crack appears on the skirt

** Major Differences between popular Shuttlecocks **
● Mavis 10
- Mavis 10 has a nylon base, other shuttles compared here have cork base. So, this lasts longer and best suited for practise sessions
- The flight performance has the least resemblance to feather shuttles. So if you practise for tournaments, I suggest not to use this. If you are a beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is a good choice
● Mavis 300 & 350
- Both these have cork base and nylon feathers
- These shuttles are a tad slower than Mavis 10 and behaviour is closer to feather shuttles in performance when compared with 10
- If you are an amateur who is serious about badminton, this is the best shuttles for you to purchase
- Most of the badminton trainers and coaching centers use either 300 or 350
- I could not experience any difference between 300 and 350, but many people think 350 is better in terms of flight path and durability and my choice of shuttles are 350
● Mavis 500
- This has got cork base and nylon feathers
- These are closer to feather shuttles in terms of flight behaviour & feel than 300/350 and the rate at which it slows down is faster. These shuttles provide more precision & control, and obviously are costlier
- Having said all these, you may not be able to spot much difference even if you are an advanced amateur. However, I have observed that the skirt starts cracking quicker than 350
● Mavis 2000
- This has got the best flight behaviour of all the above and is mostly used for tournaments if feather shuttle is not used. These shuttles are light and the speed & sturdiness are the closest to feather shuttles
● Feather Shuttles
- Nylon shuttlecocks can never match the flight behaviour of feather shuttles. If you want to gain clear control, feel, touch and master different strokes, you have to play on feather shuttles
- One of the major differences in behaviour with nylon shuttles is the dramatic slowing down of feather shuttles. Professionals and serious badminton players use feather shuttles that helps them gain superior techniques and precision control
● Cap Colour
- The colours on cap indicate the speed of the shuttle. When the climate is hot, the air resistance will be less thus making the shuttle travel faster than in cold conditions. This is compensated by using slower shuttles in hot conditions and faster shuttles in cold conditions
- Green cap is the slowest shuttle. You have to put in more power to push the shuttle to the back of the court. This is more suitable for hot and humid weather or at high altitudes
- Blue cap shuttles have medium speed and is most suited for areas where temperature is around 20 degrees
- Red is the fastest of the three and is best for temperatures around 10 degrees and at low altitudes where the air is denser
- I live in Kerala and I normally pick the green cap
● Shuttle Colour
- Colour of shuttle does not have any significance. Yellow shuttles have got more visibility over the white ones

** Summary **
● All these shuttles look almost the same. The main physical difference you can see is the size of holes in the mesh on the shuttle skirt. There are other differences in the cap material, weight of the cap, etc. that determines the behaviour of the shuttle
● If you are an amateur beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is enough which is cheaper and have the most life
● 300 or 350 is best suited if you are amateur but a serious gamer. I don't really know the difference between 300 and 350, but many people say 350 is a better one
● 500 is recommended if you want to experience shuttle behaviour closer to feathers as an amateur
● 2000 is recommended for aspiring professionals incase you don't have the luxury to practise with feathers
● Having said all these, I have to disclaim that this is from my own experience of playing the game and other players I have spoken with have different opinions, especially on the difference between 300, 350 and 500.

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),5.0 out of 5 stars,Never ever play in rain with the shuttle or near water if it gets wet it will loose its adhesive.

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought red one thinking it's going to be best shuttles for indoor, but all the shuttles in the box are defective, none of the shuttle fly properly.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic, and my experience has been somewhat mixed.

First, the positives: The scale is indeed portable and compact, making it easy to store in my kitchen drawer without taking up too much space. It's lightweight, which adds to its portability, and the design is sleek and modern, which fits well with my kitchen decor. The digital display is clear and easy to read, and the scale is user-friendly with simple controls.

However, there are several drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. The accuracy of the scale is quite disappointing, with a margin of error of about ±3 grams. For precise measurements, especially in baking or other culinary activities where accuracy is crucial, this can be quite problematic. I found myself needing to double-check measurements with another scale to ensure accuracy.

Additionally, the material quality leaves much to be desired. The scale is made of low-quality plastic, which feels flimsy and not particularly durable. I'm concerned about its longevity, especially with regular use in a busy kitchen environment. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will last very long without developing cracks or other signs of wear and tear.

In summary, while the beatXP Kitchen Scale has some convenient features and an attractive design, its lack of accuracy and low-quality materials are significant downsides. If precision and durability are important to you, you might want to consider other options on the market.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,The beatXP Kitchen Scale KS106 is an adequate product for its price. It's a basic kitchen scale that does the job, but it doesn't exceed expectations. The scale offers decent accuracy and is easy to use, making it a practical choice for those on a budget. However, the build quality and features are quite basic, which is understandable given its low cost.

If you're looking for something that just works without any bells and whistles, this scale fits the bill. But if you require more precision or durability, you might want to consider investing in a higher-end model. Overall, it's an okay product that delivers fair value for its cost.

In summary, while the beatXP Kitchen Scale has some convenient features and an attractive design, its lack of accuracy and low-quality materials are significant downsides. If precision and durability are important to you, you might want to consider other options on the market.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,The beatXP Kitchen Scale KS106 is an adequate product for its price. It's a basic kitchen scale that does the job, but it doesn't exceed expectations. The scale offers decent accuracy and is easy to use, making it a practical choice for those on a budget. However, the build quality and features are quite basic, which is understandable given its low cost.

If you're looking for something that just works without any bells and whistles, this scale fits the bill. But if you require more precision or durability, you might want to consider investing in a higher-end model. Overall, it's an okay product that delivers fair value for its cost.

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,5.0 out of 5 stars,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I cannot express how thrilled I am with my recent purchase of the Amazon basics Egg Boiler! This little appliance has truly transformed my mornings and simplified my meal prep routine.

First and foremost, let's talk about efficiency. This egg boiler is lightning-fast, delivering perfectly cooked eggs in a matter of minutes. Whether I'm craving a soft-boiled egg with a gooey center or a firm hard-boiled egg for my salads, this device consistently delivers flawless results every single time.

The simplicity of operation is another standout feature. With just a push of a button, I can select my desired level of doneness and let the egg boiler work its magic. No more hovering over a pot of boiling water, hoping for consistent results. This device takes the guesswork out of egg cooking, which is a game-changer for busy mornings.

Clean-up is a breeze with the removable parts being dishwasher-safe, saving me precious time and effort. The compact design also makes storage a non-issue, fitting perfectly in my kitchen cabinet without taking up too much space.

Additionally, I appreciate the thoughtful design elements incorporated into this egg boiler. The automatic shut-off feature ensures safety and prevents overcooking, giving me peace of mind while multitasking in the kitchen.

Overall, the Amazon basics Egg Boiler has exceeded my expectations in every aspect. It's reliable, efficient, and incredibly easy to use. If you're looking to streamline your breakfast routine and achieve consistently perfect eggs, look no further than this fantastic appliance. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable egg-cooking solution.

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a good product. Before this gas stove was used in my home. Near about 20 minutes of waste LPG gas for boilling the egg. But, this product takes only 5> to <10 minutes to boil the 7 eggs together.
But, this has 3 draw back.
1) After autoshut the boiler. If I forget to switch off the plug, after some times the boiler gets auto on.
2) Unable to make half-boil eggs with this product, even folloing the instruction to the letter.
3) Unable to crack the top of the eggs as instructed. Egg shell is very tough, it's not easy to drill. So much force and the eggs will shattered.

,Khaja Moyenudeen
Panasonic 23 L Convection Microwave Oven(NN-CT353BFDG,Black Mirror, 360° Heat Wrap, stainless steel cavity, Magic Grill),4.0 out of 5 stars,Recently we had to replace our Sharp Microwave oven that had given us stellar service for over 15 years. After a detailed comparison of products from multiple manufacturers, we decided to opt for the Panasonic 23L Convection Microwave Oven (model number NN-CT353BFDG). The reason we chose this against the others were the following:

1. We wanted a full function microwave around 21L in size. The functions we needed include grilling, reheating, defrosting, cooking, etc.
2. We wanted a microwave that was able to distribute the heat across the food kept inside.
3. Of course, we wanted one that is priced reasonably.

As I said before, after extensive research, we ordered for the Panasonic. It arrived with a few days of our ordering in spite of the pandemic. After about a month or more of use, here are our observations.

1. The Panasonic fits the requirements we had perfectly.
2. It is at a nice price point. Just around 10K.
3. It works well on whatever tasks we have put it to. It grills, heats, and cooks food perfectly.
4. It does not make to much noise, and the beep it sounds upon completion is what we are used to in Sharp.
5. We were used to have a number keyboard in the Sharp. This does not have it. But it takes only a few moments for us to get used to the new controls in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds.
6. The timer and clock are the same button. To set the time you press the button once. To set the clock, you keep the button pressed for a few seconds and you get the 24H display. You can then set the clock.
7. The Panasonic microwave is a little light in weight. We have kept it atop a rubber mat so that it does not move.
8. Panasonic sent it's engineer the same day the product arrived. He was a little disappointed we had already set the microwave up, and had started using it. But he quickly took a deep breath, and explained the features to us. It is a different matter we knew more about the product then he, as we had read the manual thoroughly a few times.
9. The manual is well written and enough for you to understand how to use the microwave.
10. We are, in general, happy with the choice and have started enjoying using the Panasonic Microwave.

The only issue, if at all any, is that since it does not have a number pad, you can set the timer for say, 17 seconds. It has to be in multiple of 10 seconds. But that is manageable.

,Khaja Moyenudeen
Panasonic 23 L Convection Microwave Oven(NN-CT353BFDG,Black Mirror, 360° Heat Wrap, stainless steel cavity, Magic Grill),4.0 out of 5 stars,Recently we had to replace our Sharp Microwave oven that had given us stellar service for over 15 years. After a detailed comparison of products from multiple manufacturers, we decided to opt for the Panasonic 23L Convection Microwave Oven (model number NN-CT353BFDG). The reason we chose this against the others were the following:

1. We wanted a full function microwave around 21L in size. The functions we needed include grilling, reheating, defrosting, cooking, etc.
2. We wanted a microwave that was able to distribute the heat across the food kept inside.
3. Of course, we wanted one that is priced reasonably.

As I said before, after extensive research, we ordered for the Panasonic. It arrived with a few days of our ordering in spite of the pandemic. After about a month or more of use, here are our observations.

1. The Panasonic fits the requirements we had perfectly.
2. It is at a nice price point. Just around 10K.
3. It works well on whatever tasks we have put it to. It grills, heats, and cooks food perfectly.
4. It does not make to much noise, and the beep it sounds upon completion is what we are used to in Sharp.
5. We were used to have a number keyboard in the Sharp. This does not have it. But it takes only a few moments for us to get used to the new controls in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds.
6. The timer and clock are the same button. To set the time you press the button once. To set the clock, you keep the button pressed for a few seconds and you get the 24H display. You can then set the clock.
7. The Panasonic microwave is a little light in weight. We have kept it atop a rubber mat so that it does not move.
8. Panasonic sent it's engineer the same day the product arrived. He was a little disappointed we had already set the microwave up, and had started using it. But he quickly took a deep breath, and explained the features to us. It is a different matter we knew more about the product then he, as we had read the manual thoroughly a few times.
9. The manual is well written and enough for you to understand how to use the microwave.
10. We are, in general, happy with the choice and have started enjoying using the Panasonic Microwave.

Misamo Enterprise PVC Wall Hooks, Pack of 15, Transparent,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased another set of these and I still got no negative feedback. It's a good product and it's perfect for people who live on rent. The process of drilling and having hooks can be lengthy, this saves time and money of course.

These hooks have been a lifesaver in my life at least. I've been using these for a few years and I can say it does what it claims. Yet I must say, these won't hold a lot of weight. If you using these for plants then you must know, that they won't hold their weight for months. Maybe some may but all of them won't. It's not the adhesive that is weak but the hook, it comes off with weight. Maybe you can use it for a smaller plant but not a heavier one. Be careful if you are trying with a heavier pot.

This is good for hanging towels, hand towels especially. I use this behind the bathroom door cus it sticks perfectly on doors. I don't know how strongly it will hold on to a wooden door but it sticks best on titles, plastic kinda doors. Yes, it does stick strongly on walls as well but as long as your wall is perfectly finished.

So anyway, to conclude with. It's perfect to hold light weight stuff.

Good knight Gold Flash Liquid Vapourizer | Mosquito Repellent Refill | Lavender Fragrance | Pack of 4 (45ml each),5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Good Knight Gold Flash Vapourizer for months, and it's super effective against mosquitoes. The lavender fragrance is a nice touch, not too overpowering. Plus, the pack of 4 lasts long, making it great value. Highly recommend for a peaceful, mosquito-free home!

The flash feature seems to be more effective when there’s a sudden increase in mosquitoes. I noticed fewer mosquito bites, even when we keep the windows open for a breeze. It kicks in when you need it most, but it’s not constantly on, so it feels like it’s working smarter, not harder.

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,The rechargeable desk lamp is a true gem for anyone looking for a blend of style, functionality, and convenience. The sleek design fits perfectly on any desk, adding a modern touch without taking up too much space.

What really sets it apart is the rechargeable feature—no more hunting for outlets or dealing with tangled cords. The battery life is impressive, lasting through long work sessions or late-night reading. Plus, the adjustable brightness levels cater to every need, whether you want a soft glow or bright light for detailed tasks. I’m fully impressed

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,My bed side reading companion.
Nice product build, light weight with a functional neck hoist, which is easily adjustable and stays at the needed position. The warm light at low illumination can work as a night lamp too. Easy to use touch control. Illumination better when plugged in but battery support is also fairly good.

Tends to topple and needs some weight in the pencil holder part to stay put.

A recent purchase but have used other products from this company and they are good. Hoping this one betters the experience

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently added WD-40 to my toolbox, and I'm thrilled with its versatility and effectiveness in various applications. Here's why I find this multipurpose spray to be an invaluable asset:

**Multipurpose Marvel:**
WD-40 truly lives up to its reputation as an all-in-one solution. From acting as a rust remover to a stain remover, lubricant, and more, its countless utilities make it a must-have for both home improvement and automotive purposes.

**Multi-Surface Magic:**
What sets WD-40 apart is its ability to seamlessly work on various surfaces. Whether it's metal, iron, chrome, wood, aluminum, or more, this spray proves its efficacy across a multitude of materials. It has become my go-to solution, not just at home but also for my vehicle and other commercial uses.

**Excellent Lubrication:**
For lubrication needs, WD-40 is unmatched. It has proven to be an excellent choice for ensuring smooth functioning of drawer channels, door hinges, sewing machines, and cycle chains. Its unique formula provides effective lubrication without causing any external damage to these surfaces.

**Powerful Degreasing Agent:**
The spray's prowess extends to effective degreasing. It effortlessly removes grime, grease, and smudges from various surfaces, including wooden tables, countertops, and metallic surfaces of vehicles. This quality makes it a reliable degreasing agent for a variety of applications.

**Active Cleaning Agent:**

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,I had a couple of Godrej locks whuch got rusted and thus become unusable as they were exposed to rainwater. Though these locks were expensive, I was planning to discard it. Then I decided to take a chance and ordered WD-40. It WORKED beautifully. The locks got loosened, almost miraculously! It does not work immediately after spraying. It does not seem to be a lubricant. I sprayed the locks with WD-40 and left them for 10 hours, and then tried to unlock them, it got UNLICKED, as if new! I recommend it.

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,You can not miss this to have it if you own a car. This thing of a piece works like magic for me. I had so many scratches on my new car and I was very afraid that I might get those parts repainted. I was literally thought of filing a claim as well for those scratches. The one i have attached in media is the smallest one there were many more worse than this.
I bought this with no expectations and very surprised by the results i got. Almost 80-90% of the scratches were removed completely when rubbed well with a microfiber cloth.
If you have scratches on your car, do not doubt a bit and go ahead with this one.

Razzai Duvet 500 GSM Winter Comforter Premium Collection Quilted Comforter (92" x 106" Inches/233cm x 269cm) - King Size Comforter|White| Microfiber| Lightweight,4.0 out of 5 stars,The fiber is very soft and cozy but the color is little bit lighter in real. I ordered silver gray. The size is 56×86 not 60×90. They should follow the standard measurements.
It is very warm enough and quickly in healy winter. If you can consider little bit small size against the very soft and good quality fiber than go for it.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,5.0 out of 5 stars,That sounds like a great product! I recently purchased bamboo tissues, and I am thoroughly impressed with their quality. Unlike regular paper tissues, these bamboo tissues are incredibly soft and durable. One of the standout features is that a single tissue lasts much longer, reducing waste significantly. This makes them not only a more sustainable choice but also a cost-effective one. I highly recommend these bamboo tissues for anyone looking for a soft, eco-friendly alternative to paper tissues.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,4.0 out of 5 stars,To start, this product's packaging is minimal and crafted from recycled materials, showcasing the company's dedication to sustainability. The tissues themselves are created from 100% natural bamboo, a highly renewable resource that is more environmentally conscious than traditional wood pulp.

Upon my initial use of the tissues, I was pleasantly surprised by their softness and gentle touch on my skin. Often, eco-friendly products can be abrasive and rough, but these tissues are luxuriously soft. Moreover, they possess a 2-ply design, making them sturdy and long-lasting. In the past, I have used other environmentally friendly tissues that easily tore or disintegrated, but these hold up well and leave no residue.

I am also thrilled that this pack contains 100 pulls per box, eliminating the need for frequent restocking. Furthermore, with a pack of 6, I have an ample supply of tissues to last me a considerable amount of time.

What I appreciate most about these tissues is that they are not only beneficial to the environment, but they are also beneficial to my skin. As someone with sensitive skin, I often react to harsh chemicals and fragrances, but these tissues contain no harmful additives.

Overall, I highly recommend the Beco Bamboo Super Soft Facial Tissue for anyone seeking a sustainable and gentle solution for their facial tissue needs. It is a small change that can have a significant impact on the environment, and it is a product that I will continue to purchase in the future.

NEWISH Pepper Spray for self Defence Small Pocket Size - Reliable and Effective Self-Defense 50 Time Spray,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this for my sister who use to travel frequently.
When we tried this spray at home, within 4-5 secs there was very spicy, itchy and unbearable odour in surrounding that we can't even stand there for 30 seconds. Intensity is very high and unbearable.
Impressed with the performance and it is pocket size so you can easily carry it.

But please be very careful while using it, don't spray it directly in the eyes of another person until and unless you're in danger because it can cause lose in eye sight.

NEWISH Pepper Spray for self Defence Small Pocket Size - Reliable and Effective Self-Defense 50 Time Spray,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this Red Cop Pepper Spray for self defence after reading some positive reviews on Amazon. I was looking for effective spray that could protect me from thieves and criminals at night. I have to say that this product has exceeded my expectations.

The spray is very easy to use and has a good range of about upto 15 feet. The nozzle always points towards the attacker's face, which ensures accuracy and prevents accidental spraying.

The spray is also very handy and can be placed anywhere, with just little space allocation. I usually carry it in my pocket, and sometimes in my bag. The spray is legal to use. I felt very safe and confident with this spray.

Overall, I am very satisfied with this Red Cop Pepper spray for self defence. It is a powerful and affordable product that gives me peace of mind and security. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to protect themselves from harm.

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),5.0 out of 5 stars,** First Impression **
● The shuttle is yellow in colour with green band at the base. The shuttle base is cork with nylon covering and the skirts are also nylon
● This comes in a carton tube with 6 shuttles packed. The carton has holograms
● The shuttles are manufactured in Japan and is imported by Sunrise Sports

** Product Verification **
● A lot of reviews here say that they think they have got a counterfeit product. You can verify your purchase at Yonex website using the serial number
● The serial number can be revealed by scratching the hologram label. Goto the website 'sunrisetnt' and enter this code there; it's case-sensitive. The site will tell you whether your purchase is genuine or not

** Performance **
● I am an amateur and play on outdoor clay court
● I play with green cap, which is slower in comparison with other caps. However after one or two games, the difference in behaviour disappears
● The recovery of shuttle after the shot is very fast and a problem with this has never been experienced or noted during the play
● The performance in flight path is also not something that gets noticed or influencing while playing badminton as an amateur
● I have been mostly using 350 and a shuttle lasts for around 10 to 15 games before it starts showing signs of disintegration. I replace the shuttle when the first crack appears on the skirt

** Major Differences between popular Shuttlecocks **
● Mavis 10
- Mavis 10 has a nylon base, other shuttles compared here have cork base. So, this lasts longer and best suited for practise sessions
- The flight performance has the least resemblance to feather shuttles. So if you practise for tournaments, I suggest not to use this. If you are a beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is a good choice
● Mavis 300 & 350
- Both these have cork base and nylon feathers
- These shuttles are a tad slower than Mavis 10 and behaviour is closer to feather shuttles in performance when compared with 10
- If you are an amateur who is serious about badminton, this is the best shuttles for you to purchase
- Most of the badminton trainers and coaching centers use either 300 or 350
- I could not experience any difference between 300 and 350, but many people think 350 is better in terms of flight path and durability and my choice of shuttles are 350
● Mavis 500
- This has got cork base and nylon feathers
- These are closer to feather shuttles in terms of flight behaviour & feel than 300/350 and the rate at which it slows down is faster. These shuttles provide more precision & control, and obviously are costlier
- Having said all these, you may not be able to spot much difference even if you are an advanced amateur. However, I have observed that the skirt starts cracking quicker than 350
● Mavis 2000
- This has got the best flight behaviour of all the above and is mostly used for tournaments if feather shuttle is not used. These shuttles are light and the speed & sturdiness are the closest to feather shuttles
● Feather Shuttles
- Nylon shuttlecocks can never match the flight behaviour of feather shuttles. If you want to gain clear control, feel, touch and master different strokes, you have to play on feather shuttles
- One of the major differences in behaviour with nylon shuttles is the dramatic slowing down of feather shuttles. Professionals and serious badminton players use feather shuttles that helps them gain superior techniques and precision control
● Cap Colour
- The colours on cap indicate the speed of the shuttle. When the climate is hot, the air resistance will be less thus making the shuttle travel faster than in cold conditions. This is compensated by using slower shuttles in hot conditions and faster shuttles in cold conditions
- Green cap is the slowest shuttle. You have to put in more power to push the shuttle to the back of the court. This is more suitable for hot and humid weather or at high altitudes
- Blue cap shuttles have medium speed and is most suited for areas where temperature is around 20 degrees
- Red is the fastest of the three and is best for temperatures around 10 degrees and at low altitudes where the air is denser
- I live in Kerala and I normally pick the green cap
● Shuttle Colour
- Colour of shuttle does not have any significance. Yellow shuttles have got more visibility over the white ones

** Summary **
● All these shuttles look almost the same. The main physical difference you can see is the size of holes in the mesh on the shuttle skirt. There are other differences in the cap material, weight of the cap, etc. that determines the behaviour of the shuttle
● If you are an amateur beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is enough which is cheaper and have the most life
● 300 or 350 is best suited if you are amateur but a serious gamer. I don't really know the difference between 300 and 350, but many people say 350 is a better one
● 500 is recommended if you want to experience shuttle behaviour closer to feathers as an amateur
● 2000 is recommended for aspiring professionals incase you don't have the luxury to practise with feathers
● Having said all these, I have to disclaim that this is from my own experience of playing the game and other players I have spoken with have different opinions, especially on the difference between 300, 350 and 500.

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),5.0 out of 5 stars,** First Impression **
● The shuttle is yellow in colour with green band at the base. The shuttle base is cork with nylon covering and the skirts are also nylon
● This comes in a carton tube with 6 shuttles packed. The carton has holograms
● The shuttles are manufactured in Japan and is imported by Sunrise Sports

** Product Verification **
● A lot of reviews here say that they think they have got a counterfeit product. You can verify your purchase at Yonex website using the serial number
● The serial number can be revealed by scratching the hologram label. Goto the website 'sunrisetnt' and enter this code there; it's case-sensitive. The site will tell you whether your purchase is genuine or not

** Performance **
● I am an amateur and play on outdoor clay court
● I play with green cap, which is slower in comparison with other caps. However after one or two games, the difference in behaviour disappears
● The recovery of shuttle after the shot is very fast and a problem with this has never been experienced or noted during the play
● The performance in flight path is also not something that gets noticed or influencing while playing badminton as an amateur
● I have been mostly using 350 and a shuttle lasts for around 10 to 15 games before it starts showing signs of disintegration. I replace the shuttle when the first crack appears on the skirt

** Major Differences between popular Shuttlecocks **
● Mavis 10
- Mavis 10 has a nylon base, other shuttles compared here have cork base. So, this lasts longer and best suited for practise sessions
- The flight performance has the least resemblance to feather shuttles. So if you practise for tournaments, I suggest not to use this. If you are a beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is a good choice
● Mavis 300 & 350
- Both these have cork base and nylon feathers
- These shuttles are a tad slower than Mavis 10 and behaviour is closer to feather shuttles in performance when compared with 10
- If you are an amateur who is serious about badminton, this is the best shuttles for you to purchase
- Most of the badminton trainers and coaching centers use either 300 or 350
- I could not experience any difference between 300 and 350, but many people think 350 is better in terms of flight path and durability and my choice of shuttles are 350
● Mavis 500
- This has got cork base and nylon feathers
- These are closer to feather shuttles in terms of flight behaviour & feel than 300/350 and the rate at which it slows down is faster. These shuttles provide more precision & control, and obviously are costlier
- Having said all these, you may not be able to spot much difference even if you are an advanced amateur. However, I have observed that the skirt starts cracking quicker than 350
● Mavis 2000
- This has got the best flight behaviour of all the above and is mostly used for tournaments if feather shuttle is not used. These shuttles are light and the speed & sturdiness are the closest to feather shuttles
● Feather Shuttles
- Nylon shuttlecocks can never match the flight behaviour of feather shuttles. If you want to gain clear control, feel, touch and master different strokes, you have to play on feather shuttles
- One of the major differences in behaviour with nylon shuttles is the dramatic slowing down of feather shuttles. Professionals and serious badminton players use feather shuttles that helps them gain superior techniques and precision control
● Cap Colour
- The colours on cap indicate the speed of the shuttle. When the climate is hot, the air resistance will be less thus making the shuttle travel faster than in cold conditions. This is compensated by using slower shuttles in hot conditions and faster shuttles in cold conditions
- Green cap is the slowest shuttle. You have to put in more power to push the shuttle to the back of the court. This is more suitable for hot and humid weather or at high altitudes
- Blue cap shuttles have medium speed and is most suited for areas where temperature is around 20 degrees
- Red is the fastest of the three and is best for temperatures around 10 degrees and at low altitudes where the air is denser
- I live in Kerala and I normally pick the green cap
● Shuttle Colour
- Colour of shuttle does not have any significance. Yellow shuttles have got more visibility over the white ones

** Summary **
● All these shuttles look almost the same. The main physical difference you can see is the size of holes in the mesh on the shuttle skirt. There are other differences in the cap material, weight of the cap, etc. that determines the behaviour of the shuttle
● If you are an amateur beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is enough which is cheaper and have the most life
● 300 or 350 is best suited if you are amateur but a serious gamer. I don't really know the difference between 300 and 350, but many people say 350 is a better one
● 500 is recommended if you want to experience shuttle behaviour closer to feathers as an amateur
● 2000 is recommended for aspiring professionals incase you don't have the luxury to practise with feathers
● Having said all these, I have to disclaim that this is from my own experience of playing the game and other players I have spoken with have different opinions, especially on the difference between 300, 350 and 500.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic, and my experience has been somewhat mixed.

First, the positives: The scale is indeed portable and compact, making it easy to store in my kitchen drawer without taking up too much space. It's lightweight, which adds to its portability, and the design is sleek and modern, which fits well with my kitchen decor. The digital display is clear and easy to read, and the scale is user-friendly with simple controls.

However, there are several drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. The accuracy of the scale is quite disappointing, with a margin of error of about ±3 grams. For precise measurements, especially in baking or other culinary activities where accuracy is crucial, this can be quite problematic. I found myself needing to double-check measurements with another scale to ensure accuracy.

Additionally, the material quality leaves much to be desired. The scale is made of low-quality plastic, which feels flimsy and not particularly durable. I'm concerned about its longevity, especially with regular use in a busy kitchen environment. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will last very long without developing cracks or other signs of wear and tear.

In summary, while the beatXP Kitchen Scale has some convenient features and an attractive design, its lack of accuracy and low-quality materials are significant downsides. If precision and durability are important to you, you might want to consider other options on the market.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,The beatXP Kitchen Scale KS106 is an adequate product for its price. It's a basic kitchen scale that does the job, but it doesn't exceed expectations. The scale offers decent accuracy and is easy to use, making it a practical choice for those on a budget. However, the build quality and features are quite basic, which is understandable given its low cost.

If you're looking for something that just works without any bells and whistles, this scale fits the bill. But if you require more precision or durability, you might want to consider investing in a higher-end model. Overall, it's an okay product that delivers fair value for its cost.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic, and my experience has been somewhat mixed.

First, the positives: The scale is indeed portable and compact, making it easy to store in my kitchen drawer without taking up too much space. It's lightweight, which adds to its portability, and the design is sleek and modern, which fits well with my kitchen decor. The digital display is clear and easy to read, and the scale is user-friendly with simple controls.

However, there are several drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. The accuracy of the scale is quite disappointing, with a margin of error of about ±3 grams. For precise measurements, especially in baking or other culinary activities where accuracy is crucial, this can be quite problematic. I found myself needing to double-check measurements with another scale to ensure accuracy.

Additionally, the material quality leaves much to be desired. The scale is made of low-quality plastic, which feels flimsy and not particularly durable. I'm concerned about its longevity, especially with regular use in a busy kitchen environment. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will last very long without developing cracks or other signs of wear and tear.

In summary, while the beatXP Kitchen Scale has some convenient features and an attractive design, its lack of accuracy and low-quality materials are significant downsides. If precision and durability are important to you, you might want to consider other options on the market.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,The beatXP Kitchen Scale KS106 is an adequate product for its price. It's a basic kitchen scale that does the job, but it doesn't exceed expectations. The scale offers decent accuracy and is easy to use, making it a practical choice for those on a budget. However, the build quality and features are quite basic, which is understandable given its low cost.

If you're looking for something that just works without any bells and whistles, this scale fits the bill. But if you require more precision or durability, you might want to consider investing in a higher-end model. Overall, it's an okay product that delivers fair value for its cost.

No more hovering over a pot of boiling water, hoping for consistent results. This device takes the guesswork out of egg cooking, which is a game-changer for busy mornings.

Clean-up is a breeze with the removable parts being dishwasher-safe, saving me precious time and effort. The compact design also makes storage a non-issue, fitting perfectly in my kitchen cabinet without taking up too much space.

Additionally, I appreciate the thoughtful design elements incorporated into this egg boiler. The automatic shut-off feature ensures safety and prevents overcooking, giving me peace of mind while multitasking in the kitchen.

Overall, the Amazon basics Egg Boiler has exceeded my expectations in every aspect. It's reliable, efficient, and incredibly easy to use. If you're looking to streamline your breakfast routine and achieve consistently perfect eggs, look no further than this fantastic appliance. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable egg-cooking solution.

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a good product. Before this gas stove was used in my home. Near about 20 minutes of waste LPG gas for boilling the egg. But, this product takes only 5> to <10 minutes to boil the 7 eggs together.
But, this has 3 draw back.
1) After autoshut the boiler. If I forget to switch off the plug, after some times the boiler gets auto on.
2) Unable to make half-boil eggs with this product, even folloing the instruction to the letter.
3) Unable to crack the top of the eggs as instructed. Egg shell is very tough, it's not easy to drill. So much force and the eggs will shattered.

Panasonic 23 L Convection Microwave Oven(NN-CT353BFDG,Black Mirror, 360° Heat Wrap, stainless steel cavity, Magic Grill),4.0 out of 5 stars,Recently we had to replace our Sharp Microwave oven that had given us stellar service for over 15 years. After a detailed comparison of products from multiple manufacturers, we decided to opt for the Panasonic 23L Convection Microwave Oven (model number NN-CT353BFDG). The reason we chose this against the others were the following:

1. We wanted a full function microwave around 21L in size. The functions we needed include grilling, reheating, defrosting, cooking, etc.
2. We wanted a microwave that was able to distribute the heat across the food kept inside.
3. Of course, we wanted one that is priced reasonably.

As I said before, after extensive research, we ordered for the Panasonic. It arrived with a few days of our ordering in spite of the pandemic. After about a month or more of use, here are our observations.

1. The Panasonic fits the requirements we had perfectly.
2. It is at a nice price point. Just around 10K.
3. It works well on whatever tasks we have put it to. It grills, heats, and cooks food perfectly.
4. It does not make to much noise, and the beep it sounds upon completion is what we are used to in Sharp.
5. We were used to have a number keyboard in the Sharp. This does not have it. But it takes only a few moments for us to get used to the new controls in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds.
6. The timer and clock are the same button. To set the time you press the button once. To set the clock, you keep the button pressed for a few seconds and you get the 24H display. You can then set the clock.
7. The Panasonic microwave is a little light in weight. We have kept it atop a rubber mat so that it does not move.
8. Panasonic sent it's engineer the same day the product arrived. He was a little disappointed we had already set the microwave up, and had started using it. But he quickly took a deep breath, and explained the features to us. It is a different matter we knew more about the product then he, as we had read the manual thoroughly a few times.
9. The manual is well written and enough for you to understand how to use the microwave.
10. We are, in general, happy with the choice and have started enjoying using the Panasonic Microwave.

The only issue, if at all any, is that since it does not have a number pad, you can set the timer for say, 17 seconds. It has to be in multiple of 10 seconds. But that is manageable.

Misamo Enterprise PVC Wall Hooks, Pack of 15, Transparent,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased another set of these and I still got no negative feedback. It's a good product and it's perfect for people who live on rent. The process of drilling and having hooks can be lengthy, this saves time and money of course.

These hooks have been a lifesaver in my life at least. I've been using these for a few years and I can say it does what it claims. Yet I must say, these won't hold a lot of weight. If you using these for plants then you must know, that they won't hold their weight for months. Maybe some may but all of them won't. It's not the adhesive that is weak but the hook, it comes off with weight. Maybe you can use it for a smaller plant but not a heavier one. Be careful if you are trying with a heavier pot.

This is good for hanging towels, hand towels especially. I use this behind the bathroom door cus it sticks perfectly on doors. I don't know how strongly it will hold on to a wooden door but it sticks best on titles, plastic kinda doors. Yes, it does stick strongly on walls as well but as long as your wall is perfectly finished.

So anyway, to conclude with. It's perfect to hold light weight stuff.

rts Universal Travel Adapter, International All in One Worldwide Travel Adapter and Wall Charger with USB Ports with Multi Type Power Outlet USB 2.1A,100-250 Voltage Travel Charger (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,I was searching for a good travel adapter for my trip to the USA, and most options were quite expensive. Then I found this one, and to be honest, I was skeptical since it was priced at just 500 while others were selling for 2000+. However, I was pleasantly surprised. This adapter exceeded my expectations. It looks great, is durable, and fits properly. I highly recommend it!

rts Universal Travel Adapter, International All in One Worldwide Travel Adapter and Wall Charger with USB Ports with Multi Type Power Outlet USB 2.1A,100-250 Voltage Travel Charger (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,Very compact product. Very handy to carry along. Used in Singapore and Cambodia. Very useful - particularly in Singapore (hotels in Cambodia had multi-adapter sockets). Nice colour too. Only difficulty faced - one of the standalone pins (of a 3 pin plug) was difficult to take out. Hence not given 5 star.

rts Universal Travel Adapter, International All in One Worldwide Travel Adapter and Wall Charger with USB Ports with Multi Type Power Outlet USB 2.1A,100-250 Voltage Travel Charger (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Does a great job. I have three of these that I use in Europe and they work great although the 2-pin (foldable) plug is a bit thin and doesn't fit too snuggly in the socket. I also think the folding mechanism feels a bit weak. Still, I've used these in Europe and India for the past 2 years or so. Recommended.

Good knight Gold Flash Liquid Vapourizer | Mosquito Repellent Refill | Lavender Fragrance | Pack of 4 (45ml each),5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Good Knight Gold Flash Vapourizer for months, and it's super effective against mosquitoes. The lavender fragrance is a nice touch, not too overpowering. Plus, the pack of 4 lasts long, making it great value. Highly recommend for a peaceful, mosquito-free home!

The flash feature seems to be more effective when there’s a sudden increase in mosquitoes. I noticed fewer mosquito bites, even when we keep the windows open for a breeze. It kicks in when you need it most, but it’s not constantly on, so it feels like it’s working smarter, not harder.

Easy to Clean: The material is simple to wipe down and clean, which is essential after using it for gym shoes or hiking boots.

Protection: It offers excellent protection for my shoes, keeping them separate from my clothes and other items in my luggage. No more worrying about dirt or scuffs.

Overall, the Bold Fit shoe bag has exceeded my expectations. It’s a must-have for anyone looking to keep their shoes organized and protected during travel or at the gym. I will definitely be purchasing another one and recommending it to my friends.

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,The rechargeable desk lamp is a true gem for anyone looking for a blend of style, functionality, and convenience. The sleek design fits perfectly on any desk, adding a modern touch without taking up too much space.

What really sets it apart is the rechargeable feature—no more hunting for outlets or dealing with tangled cords. The battery life is impressive, lasting through long work sessions or late-night reading. Plus, the adjustable brightness levels cater to every need, whether you want a soft glow or bright light for detailed tasks. I’m fully impressed

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,My bed side reading companion.
Nice product build, light weight with a functional neck hoist, which is easily adjustable and stays at the needed position. The warm light at low illumination can work as a night lamp too. Easy to use touch control. Illumination better when plugged in but battery support is also fairly good.

Tends to topple and needs some weight in the pencil holder part to stay put.

A recent purchase but have used other products from this company and they are good. Hoping this one betters the experience

Though these locks were expensive, I was planning to discard it. Then I decided to take a chance and ordered WD-40. It WORKED beautifully. The locks got loosened, almost miraculously! It does not work immediately after spraying. It does not seem to be a lubricant. I sprayed the locks with WD-40 and left them for 10 hours, and then tried to unlock them, it got UNLICKED, as if new! I recommend it.

This thing of a piece works like magic for me. I had so many scratches on my new car and I was very afraid that I might get those parts repainted. I was literally thought of filing a claim as well for those scratches. The one i have attached in media is the smallest one there were many more worse than this.
I bought this with no expectations and very surprised by the results i got. Almost 80-90% of the scratches were removed completely when rubbed well with a microfiber cloth.
If you have scratches on your car, do not doubt a bit and go ahead with this one.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,5.0 out of 5 stars,That sounds like a great product! I recently purchased bamboo tissues, and I am thoroughly impressed with their quality. Unlike regular paper tissues, these bamboo tissues are incredibly soft and durable. One of the standout features is that a single tissue lasts much longer, reducing waste significantly. This makes them not only a more sustainable choice but also a cost-effective one. I highly recommend these bamboo tissues for anyone looking for a soft, eco-friendly alternative to paper tissues.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,4.0 out of 5 stars,To start, this product's packaging is minimal and crafted from recycled materials, showcasing the company's dedication to sustainability. The tissues themselves are created from 100% natural bamboo, a highly renewable resource that is more environmentally conscious than traditional wood pulp.

Upon my initial use of the tissues, I was pleasantly surprised by their softness and gentle touch on my skin. Often, eco-friendly products can be abrasive and rough, but these tissues are luxuriously soft. Moreover, they possess a 2-ply design, making them sturdy and long-lasting. In the past, I have used other environmentally friendly tissues that easily tore or disintegrated, but these hold up well and leave no residue.

I am also thrilled that this pack contains 100 pulls per box, eliminating the need for frequent restocking. Furthermore, with a pack of 6, I have an ample supply of tissues to last me a considerable amount of time.

What I appreciate most about these tissues is that they are not only beneficial to the environment, but they are also beneficial to my skin. As someone with sensitive skin, I often react to harsh chemicals and fragrances, but these tissues contain no harmful additives.

Overall, I highly recommend the Beco Bamboo Super Soft Facial Tissue for anyone seeking a sustainable and gentle solution for their facial tissue needs. It is a small change that can have a significant impact on the environment, and it is a product that I will continue to purchase in the future.

NEWISH Pepper Spray for self Defence Small Pocket Size - Reliable and Effective Self-Defense 50 Time Spray,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this Red Cop Pepper Spray for self defence after reading some positive reviews on Amazon. I was looking for effective spray that could protect me from thieves and criminals at night. I have to say that this product has exceeded my expectations.

The spray is very easy to use and has a good range of about upto 15 feet. The nozzle always points towards the attacker's face, which ensures accuracy and prevents accidental spraying.

The spray is also very handy and can be placed anywhere, with just little space allocation. I usually carry it in my pocket, and sometimes in my bag. The spray is legal to use. I felt very safe and confident with this spray.

Overall, I am very satisfied with this Red Cop Pepper spray for self defence. It is a powerful and affordable product that gives me peace of mind and security. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to protect themselves from harm.

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),5.0 out of 5 stars,** First Impression **
● The shuttle is yellow in colour with green band at the base. The shuttle base is cork with nylon covering and the skirts are also nylon
● This comes in a carton tube with 6 shuttles packed. The carton has holograms
● The shuttles are manufactured in Japan and is imported by Sunrise Sports

** Product Verification **
● A lot of reviews here say that they think they have got a counterfeit product. You can verify your purchase at Yonex website using the serial number
● The serial number can be revealed by scratching the hologram label. Goto the website 'sunrisetnt' and enter this code there; it's case-sensitive. The site will tell you whether your purchase is genuine or not

** Performance **
● I am an amateur and play on outdoor clay court
● I play with green cap, which is slower in comparison with other caps. However after one or two games, the difference in behaviour disappears
● The recovery of shuttle after the shot is very fast and a problem with this has never been experienced or noted during the play
● The performance in flight path is also not something that gets noticed or influencing while playing badminton as an amateur
● I have been mostly using 350 and a shuttle lasts for around 10 to 15 games before it starts showing signs of disintegration. I replace the shuttle when the first crack appears on the skirt

** Major Differences between popular Shuttlecocks **
● Mavis 10
- Mavis 10 has a nylon base, other shuttles compared here have cork base. So, this lasts longer and best suited for practise sessions
- The flight performance has the least resemblance to feather shuttles. So if you practise for tournaments, I suggest not to use this. If you are a beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is a good choice
● Mavis 300 & 350
- Both these have cork base and nylon feathers
- These shuttles are a tad slower than Mavis 10 and behaviour is closer to feather shuttles in performance when compared with 10
- If you are an amateur who is serious about badminton, this is the best shuttles for you to purchase
- Most of the badminton trainers and coaching centers use either 300 or 350
- I could not experience any difference between 300 and 350, but many people think 350 is better in terms of flight path and durability and my choice of shuttles are 350
● Mavis 500
- This has got cork base and nylon feathers
- These are closer to feather shuttles in terms of flight behaviour & feel than 300/350 and the rate at which it slows down is faster. These shuttles provide more precision & control, and obviously are costlier
- Having said all these, you may not be able to spot much difference even if you are an advanced amateur. However, I have observed that the skirt starts cracking quicker than 350
● Mavis 2000
- This has got the best flight behaviour of all the above and is mostly used for tournaments if feather shuttle is not used. These shuttles are light and the speed & sturdiness are the closest to feather shuttles
● Feather Shuttles
- Nylon shuttlecocks can never match the flight behaviour of feather shuttles. If you want to gain clear control, feel, touch and master different strokes, you have to play on feather shuttles
- One of the major differences in behaviour with nylon shuttles is the dramatic slowing down of feather shuttles. Professionals and serious badminton players use feather shuttles that helps them gain superior techniques and precision control
● Cap Colour
- The colours on cap indicate the speed of the shuttle. When the climate is hot, the air resistance will be less thus making the shuttle travel faster than in cold conditions. This is compensated by using slower shuttles in hot conditions and faster shuttles in cold conditions
- Green cap is the slowest shuttle. You have to put in more power to push the shuttle to the back of the court. This is more suitable for hot and humid weather or at high altitudes
- Blue cap shuttles have medium speed and is most suited for areas where temperature is around 20 degrees
- Red is the fastest of the three and is best for temperatures around 10 degrees and at low altitudes where the air is denser
- I live in Kerala and I normally pick the green cap
● Shuttle Colour
- Colour of shuttle does not have any significance. Yellow shuttles have got more visibility over the white ones

** Summary **
● All these shuttles look almost the same. The main physical difference you can see is the size of holes in the mesh on the shuttle skirt. There are other differences in the cap material, weight of the cap, etc. that determines the behaviour of the shuttle
● If you are an amateur beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is enough which is cheaper and have the most life
● 300 or 350 is best suited if you are amateur but a serious gamer. I don't really know the difference between 300 and 350, but many people say 350 is a better one
● 500 is recommended if you want to experience shuttle behaviour closer to feathers as an amateur
● 2000 is recommended for aspiring professionals incase you don't have the luxury to practise with feathers
● Having said all these, I have to disclaim that this is from my own experience of playing the game and other players I have spoken with have different opinions, especially on the difference between 300, 350 and 500.

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),5.0 out of 5 stars,** First Impression **
● The shuttle is yellow in colour with green band at the base. The shuttle base is cork with nylon covering and the skirts are also nylon
● This comes in a carton tube with 6 shuttles packed. The carton has holograms
● The shuttles are manufactured in Japan and is imported by Sunrise Sports

** Product Verification **
● A lot of reviews here say that they think they have got a counterfeit product. You can verify your purchase at Yonex website using the serial number
● The serial number can be revealed by scratching the hologram label. Goto the website 'sunrisetnt' and enter this code there; it's case-sensitive. The site will tell you whether your purchase is genuine or not

** Performance **
● I am an amateur and play on outdoor clay court
● I play with green cap, which is slower in comparison with other caps. However after one or two games, the difference in behaviour disappears
● The recovery of shuttle after the shot is very fast and a problem with this has never been experienced or noted during the play
● The performance in flight path is also not something that gets noticed or influencing while playing badminton as an amateur
● I have been mostly using 350 and a shuttle lasts for around 10 to 15 games before it starts showing signs of disintegration. I replace the shuttle when the first crack appears on the skirt

** Major Differences between popular Shuttlecocks **
● Mavis 10
- Mavis 10 has a nylon base, other shuttles compared here have cork base. So, this lasts longer and best suited for practise sessions
- The flight performance has the least resemblance to feather shuttles. So if you practise for tournaments, I suggest not to use this. If you are a beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is a good choice
● Mavis 300 & 350
- Both these have cork base and nylon feathers
- These shuttles are a tad slower than Mavis 10 and behaviour is closer to feather shuttles in performance when compared with 10
- If you are an amateur who is serious about badminton, this is the best shuttles for you to purchase
- Most of the badminton trainers and coaching centers use either 300 or 350
- I could not experience any difference between 300 and 350, but many people think 350 is better in terms of flight path and durability and my choice of shuttles are 350
● Mavis 500
- This has got cork base and nylon feathers
- These are closer to feather shuttles in terms of flight behaviour & feel than 300/350 and the rate at which it slows down is faster. These shuttles provide more precision & control, and obviously are costlier
- Having said all these, you may not be able to spot much difference even if you are an advanced amateur. However, I have observed that the skirt starts cracking quicker than 350
● Mavis 2000
- This has got the best flight behaviour of all the above and is mostly used for tournaments if feather shuttle is not used. These shuttles are light and the speed & sturdiness are the closest to feather shuttles
● Feather Shuttles
- Nylon shuttlecocks can never match the flight behaviour of feather shuttles. If you want to gain clear control, feel, touch and master different strokes, you have to play on feather shuttles
- One of the major differences in behaviour with nylon shuttles is the dramatic slowing down of feather shuttles. Professionals and serious badminton players use feather shuttles that helps them gain superior techniques and precision control
● Cap Colour
- The colours on cap indicate the speed of the shuttle. When the climate is hot, the air resistance will be less thus making the shuttle travel faster than in cold conditions. This is compensated by using slower shuttles in hot conditions and faster shuttles in cold conditions
- Green cap is the slowest shuttle. You have to put in more power to push the shuttle to the back of the court. This is more suitable for hot and humid weather or at high altitudes
- Blue cap shuttles have medium speed and is most suited for areas where temperature is around 20 degrees
- Red is the fastest of the three and is best for temperatures around 10 degrees and at low altitudes where the air is denser
- I live in Kerala and I normally pick the green cap
● Shuttle Colour
- Colour of shuttle does not have any significance. Yellow shuttles have got more visibility over the white ones

** Summary **
● All these shuttles look almost the same. The main physical difference you can see is the size of holes in the mesh on the shuttle skirt. There are other differences in the cap material, weight of the cap, etc. that determines the behaviour of the shuttle
● If you are an amateur beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is enough which is cheaper and have the most life
● 300 or 350 is best suited if you are amateur but a serious gamer. I don't really know the difference between 300 and 350, but many people say 350 is a better one
● 500 is recommended if you want to experience shuttle behaviour closer to feathers as an amateur
● 2000 is recommended for aspiring professionals incase you don't have the luxury to practise with feathers
● Having said all these, I have to disclaim that this is from my own experience of playing the game and other players I have spoken with have different opinions, especially on the difference between 300, 350 and 500.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic, and my experience has been somewhat mixed.

First, the positives: The scale is indeed portable and compact, making it easy to store in my kitchen drawer without taking up too much space. It's lightweight, which adds to its portability, and the design is sleek and modern, which fits well with my kitchen decor. The digital display is clear and easy to read, and the scale is user-friendly with simple controls.

However, there are several drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. The accuracy of the scale is quite disappointing, with a margin of error of about ±3 grams. For precise measurements, especially in baking or other culinary activities where accuracy is crucial, this can be quite problematic. I found myself needing to double-check measurements with another scale to ensure accuracy.

Additionally, the material quality leaves much to be desired. The scale is made of low-quality plastic, which feels flimsy and not particularly durable. I'm concerned about its longevity, especially with regular use in a busy kitchen environment. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will last very long without developing cracks or other signs of wear and tear.

In summary, while the beatXP Kitchen Scale has some convenient features and an attractive design, its lack of accuracy and low-quality materials are significant downsides. If precision and durability are important to you, you might want to consider other options on the market.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,The beatXP Kitchen Scale KS106 is an adequate product for its price. It's a basic kitchen scale that does the job, but it doesn't exceed expectations. The scale offers decent accuracy and is easy to use, making it a practical choice for those on a budget. However, the build quality and features are quite basic, which is understandable given its low cost.

If you're looking for something that just works without any bells and whistles, this scale fits the bill. But if you require more precision or durability, you might want to consider investing in a higher-end model. Overall, it's an okay product that delivers fair value for its cost.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic, and my experience has been somewhat mixed.

First, the positives: The scale is indeed portable and compact, making it easy to store in my kitchen drawer without taking up too much space. It's lightweight, which adds to its portability, and the design is sleek and modern, which fits well with my kitchen decor. The digital display is clear and easy to read, and the scale is user-friendly with simple controls.

However, there are several drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. The accuracy of the scale is quite disappointing, with a margin of error of about ±3 grams. For precise measurements, especially in baking or other culinary activities where accuracy is crucial, this can be quite problematic. I found myself needing to double-check measurements with another scale to ensure accuracy.

Additionally, the material quality leaves much to be desired. The scale is made of low-quality plastic, which feels flimsy and not particularly durable. I'm concerned about its longevity, especially with regular use in a busy kitchen environment. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will last very long without developing cracks or other signs of wear and tear.

In summary, while the beatXP Kitchen Scale has some convenient features and an attractive design, its lack of accuracy and low-quality materials are significant downsides. If precision and durability are important to you, you might want to consider other options on the market.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,The beatXP Kitchen Scale KS106 is an adequate product for its price. It's a basic kitchen scale that does the job, but it doesn't exceed expectations. The scale offers decent accuracy and is easy to use, making it a practical choice for those on a budget. However, the build quality and features are quite basic, which is understandable given its low cost.

If you're looking for something that just works without any bells and whistles, this scale fits the bill. But if you require more precision or durability, you might want to consider investing in a higher-end model. Overall, it's an okay product that delivers fair value for its cost.

Material is thin, so may not keep dampness out. Also there is no handle - difficult to move it once filled with clothes.

Homestrap Set of 6 Non-Woven Printed Saree Cover/Cloth Storage/Wardrobe Organizer For Clothes with Transparent Window (Grey)(Shark Tank Featured),4.0 out of 5 stars,I had ordered the set 1-2 yrs before and that bags wer so good.. so this time I ordered again and found the bags very faulty.. almost every bag had the same issue.. the ends near zip are open..which can torn it easily..
Hence I would say to the seller to kindly check ur every single product before dispatching them..

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,5.0 out of 5 stars,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I cannot express how thrilled I am with my recent purchase of the Amazon basics Egg Boiler! This little appliance has truly transformed my mornings and simplified my meal prep routine.

First and foremost, let's talk about efficiency. This egg boiler is lightning-fast, delivering perfectly cooked eggs in a matter of minutes. Whether I'm craving a soft-boiled egg with a gooey center or a firm hard-boiled egg for my salads, this device consistently delivers flawless results every single time.

The simplicity of operation is another standout feature. With just a push of a button, I can select my desired level of doneness and let the egg boiler work its magic. No more hovering over a pot of boiling water, hoping for consistent results. This device takes the guesswork out of egg cooking, which is a game-changer for busy mornings.

Clean-up is a breeze with the removable parts being dishwasher-safe, saving me precious time and effort. The compact design also makes storage a non-issue, fitting perfectly in my kitchen cabinet without taking up too much space.

Additionally, I appreciate the thoughtful design elements incorporated into this egg boiler. The automatic shut-off feature ensures safety and prevents overcooking, giving me peace of mind while multitasking in the kitchen.

Overall, the Amazon basics Egg Boiler has exceeded my expectations in every aspect. It's reliable, efficient, and incredibly easy to use. If you're looking to streamline your breakfast routine and achieve consistently perfect eggs, look no further than this fantastic appliance. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable egg-cooking solution.

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a good product. Before this gas stove was used in my home. Near about 20 minutes of waste LPG gas for boilling the egg. But, this product takes only 5> to <10 minutes to boil the 7 eggs together.
But, this has 3 draw back.
1) After autoshut the boiler. If I forget to switch off the plug, after some times the boiler gets auto on.
2) Unable to make half-boil eggs with this product, even folloing the instruction to the letter.
3) Unable to crack the top of the eggs as instructed. Egg shell is very tough, it's not easy to drill. So much force and the eggs will shattered.

,Khaja Moyenudeen
Panasonic 23 L Convection Microwave Oven(NN-CT353BFDG,Black Mirror, 360° Heat Wrap, stainless steel cavity, Magic Grill),4.0 out of 5 stars,Recently we had to replace our Sharp Microwave oven that had given us stellar service for over 15 years. After a detailed comparison of products from multiple manufacturers, we decided to opt for the Panasonic 23L Convection Microwave Oven (model number NN-CT353BFDG). The reason we chose this against the others were the following:

1. We wanted a full function microwave around 21L in size. The functions we needed include grilling, reheating, defrosting, cooking, etc.
2. We wanted a microwave that was able to distribute the heat across the food kept inside.
3. Of course, we wanted one that is priced reasonably.

As I said before, after extensive research, we ordered for the Panasonic. It arrived with a few days of our ordering in spite of the pandemic. After about a month or more of use, here are our observations.

1. The Panasonic fits the requirements we had perfectly.
2. It is at a nice price point. Just around 10K.
3. It works well on whatever tasks we have put it to. It grills, heats, and cooks food perfectly.
4. It does not make to much noise, and the beep it sounds upon completion is what we are used to in Sharp.
5. We were used to have a number keyboard in the Sharp. This does not have it. But it takes only a few moments for us to get used to the new controls in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds.
6. The timer and clock are the same button. To set the time you press the button once. To set the clock, you keep the button pressed for a few seconds and you get the 24H display. You can then set the clock.
7. The Panasonic microwave is a little light in weight. We have kept it atop a rubber mat so that it does not move.
8. Panasonic sent it's engineer the same day the product arrived. He was a little disappointed we had already set the microwave up, and had started using it. But he quickly took a deep breath, and explained the features to us. It is a different matter we knew more about the product then he, as we had read the manual thoroughly a few times.
9. The manual is well written and enough for you to understand how to use the microwave.
10. We are, in general, happy with the choice and have started enjoying using the Panasonic Microwave.

The only issue, if at all any, is that since it does not have a number pad, you can set the timer for say, 17 seconds. It has to be in multiple of 10 seconds. But that is manageable.

,Khaja Moyenudeen
Panasonic 23 L Convection Microwave Oven(NN-CT353BFDG,Black Mirror, 360° Heat Wrap, stainless steel cavity, Magic Grill),4.0 out of 5 stars,Recently we had to replace our Sharp Microwave oven that had given us stellar service for over 15 years. After a detailed comparison of products from multiple manufacturers, we decided to opt for the Panasonic 23L Convection Microwave Oven (model number NN-CT353BFDG). The reason we chose this against the others were the following:

1. We wanted a full function microwave around 21L in size. The functions we needed include grilling, reheating, defrosting, cooking, etc.
2. We wanted a microwave that was able to distribute the heat across the food kept inside.
3. Of course, we wanted one that is priced reasonably.

As I said before, after extensive research, we ordered for the Panasonic. It arrived with a few days of our ordering in spite of the pandemic. After about a month or more of use, here are our observations.

1. The Panasonic fits the requirements we had perfectly.
2. It is at a nice price point. Just around 10K.
3. It works well on whatever tasks we have put it to. It grills, heats, and cooks food perfectly.
4. It does not make to much noise, and the beep it sounds upon completion is what we are used to in Sharp.
5. We were used to have a number keyboard in the Sharp. This does not have it. But it takes only a few moments for us to get used to the new controls in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds.
6. The timer and clock are the same button. To set the time you press the button once. To set the clock, you keep the button pressed for a few seconds and you get the 24H display. You can then set the clock.
7. The Panasonic microwave is a little light in weight. We have kept it atop a rubber mat so that it does not move.
8. Panasonic sent it's engineer the same day the product arrived. He was a little disappointed we had already set the microwave up, and had started using it. But he quickly took a deep breath, and explained the features to us. It is a different matter we knew more about the product then he, as we had read the manual thoroughly a few times.
9. The manual is well written and enough for you to understand how to use the microwave.
10. We are, in general, happy with the choice and have started enjoying using the Panasonic Microwave.

The only issue, if at all any, is that since it does not have a number pad, you can set the timer for say, 17 seconds. It has to be in multiple of 10 seconds. But that is manageable.

Misamo Enterprise PVC Wall Hooks, Pack of 15, Transparent,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased another set of these and I still got no negative feedback. It's a good product and it's perfect for people who live on rent. The process of drilling and having hooks can be lengthy, this saves time and money of course.

These hooks have been a lifesaver in my life at least. I've been using these for a few years and I can say it does what it claims. Yet I must say, these won't hold a lot of weight. If you using these for plants then you must know, that they won't hold their weight for months. Maybe some may but all of them won't. It's not the adhesive that is weak but the hook, it comes off with weight. Maybe you can use it for a smaller plant but not a heavier one. Be careful if you are trying with a heavier pot.

This is good for hanging towels, hand towels especially. I use this behind the bathroom door cus it sticks perfectly on doors. I don't know how strongly it will hold on to a wooden door but it sticks best on titles, plastic kinda doors. Yes, it does stick strongly on walls as well but as long as your wall is perfectly finished.

So anyway, to conclude with. It's perfect to hold light weight stuff.

Then I found this one, and to be honest, I was skeptical since it was priced at just 500 while others were selling for 2000+. However, I was pleasantly surprised. This adapter exceeded my expectations. It looks great, is durable, and fits properly. I highly recommend it!

rts Universal Travel Adapter, International All in One Worldwide Travel Adapter and Wall Charger with USB Ports with Multi Type Power Outlet USB 2.1A,100-250 Voltage Travel Charger (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,Very compact product. Very handy to carry along. Used in Singapore and Cambodia. Very useful - particularly in Singapore (hotels in Cambodia had multi-adapter sockets). Nice colour too. Only difficulty faced - one of the standalone pins (of a 3 pin plug) was difficult to take out. Hence not given 5 star.

rts Universal Travel Adapter, International All in One Worldwide Travel Adapter and Wall Charger with USB Ports with Multi Type Power Outlet USB 2.1A,100-250 Voltage Travel Charger (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Does a great job. I have three of these that I use in Europe and they work great although the 2-pin (foldable) plug is a bit thin and doesn't fit too snuggly in the socket. I also think the folding mechanism feels a bit weak. Still, I've used these in Europe and India for the past 2 years or so. Recommended.

Good knight Gold Flash Liquid Vapourizer | Mosquito Repellent Refill | Lavender Fragrance | Pack of 4 (45ml each),5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Good Knight Gold Flash Vapourizer for months, and it's super effective against mosquitoes. The lavender fragrance is a nice touch, not too overpowering. Plus, the pack of 4 lasts long, making it great value. Highly recommend for a peaceful, mosquito-free home!

The flash feature seems to be more effective when there’s a sudden increase in mosquitoes. I noticed fewer mosquito bites, even when we keep the windows open for a breeze. It kicks in when you need it most, but it’s not constantly on, so it feels like it’s working smarter, not harder.

Design: The shoe bag features a modern and stylish design with a strong zipper and a convenient handle. It’s compact but roomy enough to fit my shoes comfortably, making it ideal for both travel and gym use.

Versatility: This bag isn’t just for shoes. I’ve used it to store toiletries, gym gear, and other essentials when traveling. It’s a versatile addition to my luggage.

Ventilation: One of the best features is the ventilation. The bag has mesh panels that allow air to circulate, preventing odors and keeping my shoes fresh.

Easy to Clean: The material is simple to wipe down and clean, which is essential after using it for gym shoes or hiking boots.

Protection: It offers excellent protection for my shoes, keeping them separate from my clothes and other items in my luggage. No more worrying about dirt or scuffs.

Overall, the Bold Fit shoe bag has exceeded my expectations. It’s a must-have for anyone looking to keep their shoes organized and protected during travel or at the gym. I will definitely be purchasing another one and recommending it to my friends.

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,The rechargeable desk lamp is a true gem for anyone looking for a blend of style, functionality, and convenience. The sleek design fits perfectly on any desk, adding a modern touch without taking up too much space.

What really sets it apart is the rechargeable feature—no more hunting for outlets or dealing with tangled cords. The battery life is impressive, lasting through long work sessions or late-night reading. Plus, the adjustable brightness levels cater to every need, whether you want a soft glow or bright light for detailed tasks. I’m fully impressed

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,My bed side reading companion.
Nice product build, light weight with a functional neck hoist, which is easily adjustable and stays at the needed position. The warm light at low illumination can work as a night lamp too. Easy to use touch control. Illumination better when plugged in but battery support is also fairly good.

Tends to topple and needs some weight in the pencil holder part to stay put.

A recent purchase but have used other products from this company and they are good. Hoping this one betters the experience

Here's why I find this multipurpose spray to be an invaluable asset:

**Multipurpose Marvel:**

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,I had a couple of Godrej locks whuch got rusted and thus become unusable as they were exposed to rainwater. Though these locks were expensive, I was planning to discard it. Then I decided to take a chance and ordered WD-40. It WORKED beautifully. The locks got loosened, almost miraculously! It does not work immediately after spraying. It does not seem to be a lubricant. I sprayed the locks with WD-40 and left them for 10 hours, and then tried to unlock them, it got UNLICKED, as if new! I recommend it.

This thing of a piece works like magic for me. I had so many scratches on my new car and I was very afraid that I might get those parts repainted. I was literally thought of filing a claim as well for those scratches. The one i have attached in media is the smallest one there were many more worse than this.
I bought this with no expectations and very surprised by the results i got. Almost 80-90% of the scratches were removed completely when rubbed well with a microfiber cloth.
If you have scratches on your car, do not doubt a bit and go ahead with this one.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,5.0 out of 5 stars,That sounds like a great product! I recently purchased bamboo tissues, and I am thoroughly impressed with their quality. Unlike regular paper tissues, these bamboo tissues are incredibly soft and durable. One of the standout features is that a single tissue lasts much longer, reducing waste significantly. This makes them not only a more sustainable choice but also a cost-effective one. I highly recommend these bamboo tissues for anyone looking for a soft, eco-friendly alternative to paper tissues.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,4.0 out of 5 stars,To start, this product's packaging is minimal and crafted from recycled materials, showcasing the company's dedication to sustainability. The tissues themselves are created from 100% natural bamboo, a highly renewable resource that is more environmentally conscious than traditional wood pulp.

Upon my initial use of the tissues, I was pleasantly surprised by their softness and gentle touch on my skin. Often, eco-friendly products can be abrasive and rough, but these tissues are luxuriously soft. Moreover, they possess a 2-ply design, making them sturdy and long-lasting. In the past, I have used other environmentally friendly tissues that easily tore or disintegrated, but these hold up well and leave no residue.

I am also thrilled that this pack contains 100 pulls per box, eliminating the need for frequent restocking. Furthermore, with a pack of 6, I have an ample supply of tissues to last me a considerable amount of time.

What I appreciate most about these tissues is that they are not only beneficial to the environment, but they are also beneficial to my skin. As someone with sensitive skin, I often react to harsh chemicals and fragrances, but these tissues contain no harmful additives.

Overall, I highly recommend the Beco Bamboo Super Soft Facial Tissue for anyone seeking a sustainable and gentle solution for their facial tissue needs. It is a small change that can have a significant impact on the environment, and it is a product that I will continue to purchase in the future.

One of the standout features is that a single tissue lasts much longer, reducing waste significantly. This makes them not only a more sustainable choice but also a cost-effective one. I highly recommend these bamboo tissues for anyone looking for a soft, eco-friendly alternative to paper tissues.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,4.0 out of 5 stars,To start, this product's packaging is minimal and crafted from recycled materials, showcasing the company's dedication to sustainability. The tissues themselves are created from 100% natural bamboo, a highly renewable resource that is more environmentally conscious than traditional wood pulp.

Upon my initial use of the tissues, I was pleasantly surprised by their softness and gentle touch on my skin. Often, eco-friendly products can be abrasive and rough, but these tissues are luxuriously soft. Moreover, they possess a 2-ply design, making them sturdy and long-lasting. In the past, I have used other environmentally friendly tissues that easily tore or disintegrated, but these hold up well and leave no residue.

I am also thrilled that this pack contains 100 pulls per box, eliminating the need for frequent restocking. Furthermore, with a pack of 6, I have an ample supply of tissues to last me a considerable amount of time.

What I appreciate most about these tissues is that they are not only beneficial to the environment, but they are also beneficial to my skin. As someone with sensitive skin, I often react to harsh chemicals and fragrances, but these tissues contain no harmful additives.

Overall, I highly recommend the Beco Bamboo Super Soft Facial Tissue for anyone seeking a sustainable and gentle solution for their facial tissue needs. It is a small change that can have a significant impact on the environment, and it is a product that I will continue to purchase in the future.

NEWISH Pepper Spray for self Defence Small Pocket Size - Reliable and Effective Self-Defense 50 Time Spray,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this for my sister who use to travel frequently.
When we tried this spray at home, within 4-5 secs there was very spicy, itchy and unbearable odour in surrounding that we can't even stand there for 30 seconds. Intensity is very high and unbearable.
Impressed with the performance and it is pocket size so you can easily carry it.
Recommend this to every girl as a first aid for protection.

But please be very careful while using it, don't spray it directly in the eyes of another person until and unless you're in danger because it can cause lose in eye sight.

NEWISH Pepper Spray for self Defence Small Pocket Size - Reliable and Effective Self-Defense 50 Time Spray,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this Red Cop Pepper Spray for self defence after reading some positive reviews on Amazon. I was looking for effective spray that could protect me from thieves and criminals at night. I have to say that this product has exceeded my expectations.

The spray is very easy to use and has a good range of about upto 15 feet. The nozzle always points towards the attacker's face, which ensures accuracy and prevents accidental spraying.

The spray is also very handy and can be placed anywhere, with just little space allocation. I usually carry it in my pocket, and sometimes in my bag. The spray is legal to use. I felt very safe and confident with this spray.

Overall, I am very satisfied with this Red Cop Pepper spray for self defence. It is a powerful and affordable product that gives me peace of mind and security. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to protect themselves from harm.

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),5.0 out of 5 stars,** First Impression **
● The shuttle is yellow in colour with green band at the base. The shuttle base is cork with nylon covering and the skirts are also nylon
● This comes in a carton tube with 6 shuttles packed. The carton has holograms
● The shuttles are manufactured in Japan and is imported by Sunrise Sports

** Product Verification **
● A lot of reviews here say that they think they have got a counterfeit product. You can verify your purchase at Yonex website using the serial number
● The serial number can be revealed by scratching the hologram label. Goto the website 'sunrisetnt' and enter this code there; it's case-sensitive. The site will tell you whether your purchase is genuine or not

** Performance **
● I am an amateur and play on outdoor clay court
● I play with green cap, which is slower in comparison with other caps. However after one or two games, the difference in behaviour disappears
● The recovery of shuttle after the shot is very fast and a problem with this has never been experienced or noted during the play
● The performance in flight path is also not something that gets noticed or influencing while playing badminton as an amateur
● I have been mostly using 350 and a shuttle lasts for around 10 to 15 games before it starts showing signs of disintegration. I replace the shuttle when the first crack appears on the skirt

** Major Differences between popular Shuttlecocks **
● Mavis 10
- Mavis 10 has a nylon base, other shuttles compared here have cork base. So, this lasts longer and best suited for practise sessions
- The flight performance has the least resemblance to feather shuttles. So if you practise for tournaments, I suggest not to use this. If you are a beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is a good choice
● Mavis 300 & 350
- Both these have cork base and nylon feathers
- These shuttles are a tad slower than Mavis 10 and behaviour is closer to feather shuttles in performance when compared with 10
- If you are an amateur who is serious about badminton, this is the best shuttles for you to purchase
- Most of the badminton trainers and coaching centers use either 300 or 350
- I could not experience any difference between 300 and 350, but many people think 350 is better in terms of flight path and durability and my choice of shuttles are 350
● Mavis 500
- This has got cork base and nylon feathers
- These are closer to feather shuttles in terms of flight behaviour & feel than 300/350 and the rate at which it slows down is faster. These shuttles provide more precision & control, and obviously are costlier
- Having said all these, you may not be able to spot much difference even if you are an advanced amateur. However, I have observed that the skirt starts cracking quicker than 350
● Mavis 2000
- This has got the best flight behaviour of all the above and is mostly used for tournaments if feather shuttle is not used. These shuttles are light and the speed & sturdiness are the closest to feather shuttles
● Feather Shuttles
- Nylon shuttlecocks can never match the flight behaviour of feather shuttles. If you want to gain clear control, feel, touch and master different strokes, you have to play on feather shuttles
- One of the major differences in behaviour with nylon shuttles is the dramatic slowing down of feather shuttles. Professionals and serious badminton players use feather shuttles that helps them gain superior techniques and precision control
● Cap Colour
- The colours on cap indicate the speed of the shuttle. When the climate is hot, the air resistance will be less thus making the shuttle travel faster than in cold conditions. This is compensated by using slower shuttles in hot conditions and faster shuttles in cold conditions
- Green cap is the slowest shuttle. You have to put in more power to push the shuttle to the back of the court. This is more suitable for hot and humid weather or at high altitudes
- Blue cap shuttles have medium speed and is most suited for areas where temperature is around 20 degrees
- Red is the fastest of the three and is best for temperatures around 10 degrees and at low altitudes where the air is denser
- I live in Kerala and I normally pick the green cap
● Shuttle Colour
- Colour of shuttle does not have any significance. Yellow shuttles have got more visibility over the white ones

** Summary **
● All these shuttles look almost the same. The main physical difference you can see is the size of holes in the mesh on the shuttle skirt. There are other differences in the cap material, weight of the cap, etc. that determines the behaviour of the shuttle
● If you are an amateur beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is enough which is cheaper and have the most life
● 300 or 350 is best suited if you are amateur but a serious gamer. I don't really know the difference between 300 and 350, but many people say 350 is a better one
● 500 is recommended if you want to experience shuttle behaviour closer to feathers as an amateur
● 2000 is recommended for aspiring professionals incase you don't have the luxury to practise with feathers
● Having said all these, I have to disclaim that this is from my own experience of playing the game and other players I have spoken with have different opinions, especially on the difference between 300, 350 and 500.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic, and my experience has been somewhat mixed.

First, the positives: The scale is indeed portable and compact, making it easy to store in my kitchen drawer without taking up too much space. It's lightweight, which adds to its portability, and the design is sleek and modern, which fits well with my kitchen decor. The digital display is clear and easy to read, and the scale is user-friendly with simple controls.

However, there are several drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. The accuracy of the scale is quite disappointing, with a margin of error of about ±3 grams. For precise measurements, especially in baking or other culinary activities where accuracy is crucial, this can be quite problematic. I found myself needing to double-check measurements with another scale to ensure accuracy.

Additionally, the material quality leaves much to be desired. The scale is made of low-quality plastic, which feels flimsy and not particularly durable. I'm concerned about its longevity, especially with regular use in a busy kitchen environment. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will last very long without developing cracks or other signs of wear and tear.

In summary, while the beatXP Kitchen Scale has some convenient features and an attractive design, its lack of accuracy and low-quality materials are significant downsides. If precision and durability are important to you, you might want to consider other options on the market.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,The beatXP Kitchen Scale KS106 is an adequate product for its price. It's a basic kitchen scale that does the job, but it doesn't exceed expectations. The scale offers decent accuracy and is easy to use, making it a practical choice for those on a budget. However, the build quality and features are quite basic, which is understandable given its low cost.

If you're looking for something that just works without any bells and whistles, this scale fits the bill. But if you require more precision or durability, you might want to consider investing in a higher-end model. Overall, it's an okay product that delivers fair value for its cost.

Could be more happy if the depth of the containers r little deeper, especially for vegetables as we used for. Other thing is covers r can't be closed easily, it needs attention to do so and even gets loose subsequently. Otherwise material seems not bad. Size options or assorted size may help people to choose as per their requirement.

VOLTURI Fridge Storage Boxes (Pack of 6), Fridge Organisers with Removable Drain Plate, Fridge Storage Containers Keeps Fruits, Vegetables, Pantry Items Stackable, Space-Saving Storage Box Set, 1.5L,4.0 out of 5 stars,Liked the product. Could be more happy if the depth of the containers r little deeper, especially for vegetables as we used for. Other thing is covers r can't be closed easily, it needs attention to do so and even gets loose subsequently. Otherwise material seems not bad. Size options or assorted size may help people to choose as per their requirement.

Whether I'm craving a soft-boiled egg with a gooey center or a firm hard-boiled egg for my salads, this device consistently delivers flawless results every single time.

The simplicity of operation is another standout feature. With just a push of a button, I can select my desired level of doneness and let the egg boiler work its magic. No more hovering over a pot of boiling water, hoping for consistent results. This device takes the guesswork out of egg cooking, which is a game-changer for busy mornings.

Clean-up is a breeze with the removable parts being dishwasher-safe, saving me precious time and effort. The compact design also makes storage a non-issue, fitting perfectly in my kitchen cabinet without taking up too much space.

Additionally, I appreciate the thoughtful design elements incorporated into this egg boiler. The automatic shut-off feature ensures safety and prevents overcooking, giving me peace of mind while multitasking in the kitchen.

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a good product. Before this gas stove was used in my home. Near about 20 minutes of waste LPG gas for boilling the egg. But, this product takes only 5> to <10 minutes to boil the 7 eggs together.
But, this has 3 draw back.
1) After autoshut the boiler. If I forget to switch off the plug, after some times the boiler gets auto on.
2) Unable to make half-boil eggs with this product, even folloing the instruction to the letter.
3) Unable to crack the top of the eggs as instructed. Egg shell is very tough, it's not easy to drill. So much force and the eggs will shattered.

Panasonic 23 L Convection Microwave Oven(NN-CT353BFDG,Black Mirror, 360° Heat Wrap, stainless steel cavity, Magic Grill),4.0 out of 5 stars,Recently we had to replace our Sharp Microwave oven that had given us stellar service for over 15 years. After a detailed comparison of products from multiple manufacturers, we decided to opt for the Panasonic 23L Convection Microwave Oven (model number NN-CT353BFDG). The reason we chose this against the others were the following:

1. We wanted a full function microwave around 21L in size. The functions we needed include grilling, reheating, defrosting, cooking, etc.
2. We wanted a microwave that was able to distribute the heat across the food kept inside.
3. Of course, we wanted one that is priced reasonably.

As I said before, after extensive research, we ordered for the Panasonic. It arrived with a few days of our ordering in spite of the pandemic. After about a month or more of use, here are our observations.

1. The Panasonic fits the requirements we had perfectly.
2. It is at a nice price point. Just around 10K.
3. It works well on whatever tasks we have put it to. It grills, heats, and cooks food perfectly.
4. It does not make to much noise, and the beep it sounds upon completion is what we are used to in Sharp.
5. We were used to have a number keyboard in the Sharp. This does not have it. But it takes only a few moments for us to get used to the new controls in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds.
6. The timer and clock are the same button. To set the time you press the button once. To set the clock, you keep the button pressed for a few seconds and you get the 24H display. You can then set the clock.
7. The Panasonic microwave is a little light in weight. We have kept it atop a rubber mat so that it does not move.
8. Panasonic sent it's engineer the same day the product arrived. He was a little disappointed we had already set the microwave up, and had started using it. But he quickly took a deep breath, and explained the features to us. It is a different matter we knew more about the product then he, as we had read the manual thoroughly a few times.
9. The manual is well written and enough for you to understand how to use the microwave.
10. We are, in general, happy with the choice and have started enjoying using the Panasonic Microwave.

The only issue, if at all any, is that since it does not have a number pad, you can set the timer for say, 17 seconds. It has to be in multiple of 10 seconds. But that is manageable.

Misamo Enterprise PVC Wall Hooks, Pack of 15, Transparent,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased another set of these and I still got no negative feedback. It's a good product and it's perfect for people who live on rent. The process of drilling and having hooks can be lengthy, this saves time and money of course.

These hooks have been a lifesaver in my life at least. I've been using these for a few years and I can say it does what it claims. Yet I must say, these won't hold a lot of weight. If you using these for plants then you must know, that they won't hold their weight for months. Maybe some may but all of them won't. It's not the adhesive that is weak but the hook, it comes off with weight. Maybe you can use it for a smaller plant but not a heavier one. Be careful if you are trying with a heavier pot.

This is good for hanging towels, hand towels especially. I use this behind the bathroom door cus it sticks perfectly on doors. I don't know how strongly it will hold on to a wooden door but it sticks best on titles, plastic kinda doors. Yes, it does stick strongly on walls as well but as long as your wall is perfectly finished.

So anyway, to conclude with. It's perfect to hold light weight stuff.

Good knight Gold Flash Liquid Vapourizer | Mosquito Repellent Refill | Lavender Fragrance | Pack of 4 (45ml each),5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using the Good Knight Gold Flash Vapourizer for months, and it's super effective against mosquitoes. The lavender fragrance is a nice touch, not too overpowering. Plus, the pack of 4 lasts long, making it great value. Highly recommend for a peaceful, mosquito-free home!

The flash feature seems to be more effective when there’s a sudden increase in mosquitoes. I noticed fewer mosquito bites, even when we keep the windows open for a breeze. It kicks in when you need it most, but it’s not constantly on, so it feels like it’s working smarter, not harder.

Boldfit Shoe Bag for Travel & Storage Travel Organizer for Women & Men Travel Accessories Shoe Organizer Shoe Bags Pouches Travel Shoe Cover for Travelling Travel Essentials,4.0 out of 5 stars,I recently bought a shoe bag from Bold Fit, and I am extremely satisfied with its quality and practicality. Here are a few reasons why I highly recommend this product:

Durability: This shoe bag is made from very robust material that can withstand a lot of wear and tear. It feels solid and has remained in excellent condition even with frequent use.

Design: The shoe bag features a modern and stylish design with a strong zipper and a convenient handle. It’s compact but roomy enough to fit my shoes comfortably, making it ideal for both travel and gym use.

Versatility: This bag isn’t just for shoes. I’ve used it to store toiletries, gym gear, and other essentials when traveling. It’s a versatile addition to my luggage.

Ventilation: One of the best features is the ventilation. The bag has mesh panels that allow air to circulate, preventing odors and keeping my shoes fresh.

Easy to Clean: The material is simple to wipe down and clean, which is essential after using it for gym shoes or hiking boots.

Protection: It offers excellent protection for my shoes, keeping them separate from my clothes and other items in my luggage. No more worrying about dirt or scuffs.

Overall, the Bold Fit shoe bag has exceeded my expectations. It’s a must-have for anyone looking to keep their shoes organized and protected during travel or at the gym. I will definitely be purchasing another one and recommending it to my friends.

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),5.0 out of 5 stars,The rechargeable desk lamp is a true gem for anyone looking for a blend of style, functionality, and convenience. The sleek design fits perfectly on any desk, adding a modern touch without taking up too much space.

What really sets it apart is the rechargeable feature—no more hunting for outlets or dealing with tangled cords. The battery life is impressive, lasting through long work sessions or late-night reading. Plus, the adjustable brightness levels cater to every need, whether you want a soft glow or bright light for detailed tasks. I’m fully impressed

WEIRD WOLF 3 Colour Mode LED Study/Table/Desk Lamp with Pen Holder, 6 Month Warranty(Plastic, White, Pack of 1),4.0 out of 5 stars,My bed side reading companion.
Nice product build, light weight with a functional neck hoist, which is easily adjustable and stays at the needed position. The warm light at low illumination can work as a night lamp too. Easy to use touch control. Illumination better when plugged in but battery support is also fairly good.

Tends to topple and needs some weight in the pencil holder part to stay put.

A recent purchase but have used other products from this company and they are good. Hoping this one betters the experience

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,I had a couple of Godrej locks whuch got rusted and thus become unusable as they were exposed to rainwater. Though these locks were expensive, I was planning to discard it. Then I decided to take a chance and ordered WD-40. It WORKED beautifully. The locks got loosened, almost miraculously! It does not work immediately after spraying. It does not seem to be a lubricant. I sprayed the locks with WD-40 and left them for 10 hours, and then tried to unlock them, it got UNLICKED, as if new! I recommend it.

Pidilite WD-40, Multipurpose Spray, Rust Remover, Hinge Lubricant, Stain Remover, Degreaser, and Cleaning Agent, 420ml (341g),5.0 out of 5 stars,You can not miss this to have it if you own a car. This thing of a piece works like magic for me. I had so many scratches on my new car and I was very afraid that I might get those parts repainted. I was literally thought of filing a claim as well for those scratches. The one i have attached in media is the smallest one there were many more worse than this.
I bought this with no expectations and very surprised by the results i got. Almost 80-90% of the scratches were removed completely when rubbed well with a microfiber cloth.
If you have scratches on your car, do not doubt a bit and go ahead with this one.

Upon my initial use of the tissues, I was pleasantly surprised by their softness and gentle touch on my skin. Often, eco-friendly products can be abrasive and rough, but these tissues are luxuriously soft. Moreover, they possess a 2-ply design, making them sturdy and long-lasting. In the past, I have used other environmentally friendly tissues that easily tore or disintegrated, but these hold up well and leave no residue.

I am also thrilled that this pack contains 100 pulls per box, eliminating the need for frequent restocking. Furthermore, with a pack of 6, I have an ample supply of tissues to last me a considerable amount of time.

What I appreciate most about these tissues is that they are not only beneficial to the environment, but they are also beneficial to my skin. As someone with sensitive skin, I often react to harsh chemicals and fragrances, but these tissues contain no harmful additives.

Overall, I highly recommend the Beco Bamboo Super Soft Facial Tissue for anyone seeking a sustainable and gentle solution for their facial tissue needs. It is a small change that can have a significant impact on the environment, and it is a product that I will continue to purchase in the future.

Beco Bamboo Soft Facial Tissue Papers- 100 Pulls (Pack of 6), 600 Pulls - 2 ply,100% Natural and Ecofriendly, Soft tissue box/pack,5.0 out of 5 stars,That sounds like a great product! I recently purchased bamboo tissues, and I am thoroughly impressed with their quality. Unlike regular paper tissues, these bamboo tissues are incredibly soft and durable. One of the standout features is that a single tissue lasts much longer, reducing waste significantly. This makes them not only a more sustainable choice but also a cost-effective one. I highly recommend these bamboo tissues for anyone looking for a soft, eco-friendly alternative to paper tissues.

NEWISH Pepper Spray for self Defence Small Pocket Size - Reliable and Effective Self-Defense 50 Time Spray,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this for my sister who use to travel frequently.
When we tried this spray at home, within 4-5 secs there was very spicy, itchy and unbearable odour in surrounding that we can't even stand there for 30 seconds. Intensity is very high and unbearable.
Impressed with the performance and it is pocket size so you can easily carry it.
Recommend this to every girl as a first aid for protection.

But please be very careful while using it, don't spray it directly in the eyes of another person until and unless you're in danger because it can cause lose in eye sight.

NEWISH Pepper Spray for self Defence Small Pocket Size - Reliable and Effective Self-Defense 50 Time Spray,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this Red Cop Pepper Spray for self defence after reading some positive reviews on Amazon. I was looking for effective spray that could protect me from thieves and criminals at night. I have to say that this product has exceeded my expectations.

The spray is very easy to use and has a good range of about upto 15 feet. The nozzle always points towards the attacker's face, which ensures accuracy and prevents accidental spraying.

The spray is also very handy and can be placed anywhere, with just little space allocation. I usually carry it in my pocket, and sometimes in my bag. The spray is legal to use. I felt very safe and confident with this spray.

Overall, I am very satisfied with this Red Cop Pepper spray for self defence. It is a powerful and affordable product that gives me peace of mind and security. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to protect themselves from harm.

Yonex Mavis 350 Green Cap Nylon Shuttlecock (Yellow),5.0 out of 5 stars,** First Impression **
● The shuttle is yellow in colour with green band at the base. The shuttle base is cork with nylon covering and the skirts are also nylon
● This comes in a carton tube with 6 shuttles packed. The carton has holograms
● The shuttles are manufactured in Japan and is imported by Sunrise Sports

** Product Verification **
● A lot of reviews here say that they think they have got a counterfeit product. You can verify your purchase at Yonex website using the serial number
● The serial number can be revealed by scratching the hologram label. Goto the website 'sunrisetnt' and enter this code there; it's case-sensitive. The site will tell you whether your purchase is genuine or not

** Performance **
● I am an amateur and play on outdoor clay court
● I play with green cap, which is slower in comparison with other caps. However after one or two games, the difference in behaviour disappears
● The recovery of shuttle after the shot is very fast and a problem with this has never been experienced or noted during the play
● The performance in flight path is also not something that gets noticed or influencing while playing badminton as an amateur
● I have been mostly using 350 and a shuttle lasts for around 10 to 15 games before it starts showing signs of disintegration. I replace the shuttle when the first crack appears on the skirt

** Major Differences between popular Shuttlecocks **
● Mavis 10
- Mavis 10 has a nylon base, other shuttles compared here have cork base. So, this lasts longer and best suited for practise sessions
- The flight performance has the least resemblance to feather shuttles. So if you practise for tournaments, I suggest not to use this. If you are a beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is a good choice
● Mavis 300 & 350
- Both these have cork base and nylon feathers
- These shuttles are a tad slower than Mavis 10 and behaviour is closer to feather shuttles in performance when compared with 10
- If you are an amateur who is serious about badminton, this is the best shuttles for you to purchase
- Most of the badminton trainers and coaching centers use either 300 or 350
- I could not experience any difference between 300 and 350, but many people think 350 is better in terms of flight path and durability and my choice of shuttles are 350
● Mavis 500
- This has got cork base and nylon feathers
- These are closer to feather shuttles in terms of flight behaviour & feel than 300/350 and the rate at which it slows down is faster. These shuttles provide more precision & control, and obviously are costlier
- Having said all these, you may not be able to spot much difference even if you are an advanced amateur. However, I have observed that the skirt starts cracking quicker than 350
● Mavis 2000
- This has got the best flight behaviour of all the above and is mostly used for tournaments if feather shuttle is not used. These shuttles are light and the speed & sturdiness are the closest to feather shuttles
● Feather Shuttles
- Nylon shuttlecocks can never match the flight behaviour of feather shuttles. If you want to gain clear control, feel, touch and master different strokes, you have to play on feather shuttles
- One of the major differences in behaviour with nylon shuttles is the dramatic slowing down of feather shuttles. Professionals and serious badminton players use feather shuttles that helps them gain superior techniques and precision control
● Cap Colour
- The colours on cap indicate the speed of the shuttle. When the climate is hot, the air resistance will be less thus making the shuttle travel faster than in cold conditions. This is compensated by using slower shuttles in hot conditions and faster shuttles in cold conditions
- Green cap is the slowest shuttle. You have to put in more power to push the shuttle to the back of the court. This is more suitable for hot and humid weather or at high altitudes
- Blue cap shuttles have medium speed and is most suited for areas where temperature is around 20 degrees
- Red is the fastest of the three and is best for temperatures around 10 degrees and at low altitudes where the air is denser
- I live in Kerala and I normally pick the green cap
● Shuttle Colour
- Colour of shuttle does not have any significance. Yellow shuttles have got more visibility over the white ones

** Summary **
● All these shuttles look almost the same. The main physical difference you can see is the size of holes in the mesh on the shuttle skirt. There are other differences in the cap material, weight of the cap, etc. that determines the behaviour of the shuttle
● If you are an amateur beginner who plays for exercise, Mavis 10 is enough which is cheaper and have the most life
● 300 or 350 is best suited if you are amateur but a serious gamer. I don't really know the difference between 300 and 350, but many people say 350 is a better one
● 500 is recommended if you want to experience shuttle behaviour closer to feathers as an amateur
● 2000 is recommended for aspiring professionals incase you don't have the luxury to practise with feathers
● Having said all these, I have to disclaim that this is from my own experience of playing the game and other players I have spoken with have different opinions, especially on the difference between 300, 350 and 500.

beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic Digital Weighing Scale | Weight Machine With Back light LCD Display | White |10 kg | 2 Year Warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the beatXP Kitchen Scale Multipurpose Portable Electronic, and my experience has been somewhat mixed.

First, the positives: The scale is indeed portable and compact, making it easy to store in my kitchen drawer without taking up too much space. It's lightweight, which adds to its portability, and the design is sleek and modern, which fits well with my kitchen decor. The digital display is clear and easy to read, and the scale is user-friendly with simple controls.

However, there are several drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. The accuracy of the scale is quite disappointing, with a margin of error of about ±3 grams. For precise measurements, especially in baking or other culinary activities where accuracy is crucial, this can be quite problematic. I found myself needing to double-check measurements with another scale to ensure accuracy.

Additionally, the material quality leaves much to be desired. The scale is made of low-quality plastic, which feels flimsy and not particularly durable. I'm concerned about its longevity, especially with regular use in a busy kitchen environment. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will last very long without developing cracks or other signs of wear and tear.

In summary, while the beatXP Kitchen Scale has some convenient features and an attractive design, its lack of accuracy and low-quality materials are significant downsides. If precision and durability are important to you, you might want to consider other options on the market.

It's a basic kitchen scale that does the job, but it doesn't exceed expectations. The scale offers decent accuracy and is easy to use, making it a practical choice for those on a budget. However, the build quality and features are quite basic, which is understandable given its low cost.

If you're looking for something that just works without any bells and whistles, this scale fits the bill. But if you require more precision or durability, you might want to consider investing in a higher-end model. Overall, it's an okay product that delivers fair value for its cost.

Durability: Made from food-grade PP material, these containers seem sturdy and long-lasting.
Dishwasher Safe: Easy cleanup is always a plus!
Potential Downsides:

Airtightness: Some reviewers mentioned the lids might not be completely airtight. This could be a concern if you plan to store strong-smelling foods.
Recommendation:

If you're looking for a practical way to organize your fridge and extend the life of your produce, these VOLTURI Fridge Storage Boxes are a great option. The removable drain plate is a unique feature that helps prevent spoilage, and the stackable design maximizes space. Just be aware that the lids might not be completely airtight

The simplicity of operation is another standout feature. With just a push of a button, I can select my desired level of doneness and let the egg boiler work its magic. No more hovering over a pot of boiling water, hoping for consistent results. This device takes the guesswork out of egg cooking, which is a game-changer for busy mornings.

Amazon Basics Electric Egg Boiler | 3 Boiling Modes | Automatic Operation | Overheat Protection|75ml|Plastic|White,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a good product. Before this gas stove was used in my home. Near about 20 minutes of waste LPG gas for boilling the egg. But, this product takes only 5> to <10 minutes to boil the 7 eggs together.
But, this has 3 draw back.
1) After autoshut the boiler. If I forget to switch off the plug, after some times the boiler gets auto on.
2) Unable to make half-boil eggs with this product, even folloing the instruction to the letter.
3) Unable to crack the top of the eggs as instructed. Egg shell is very tough, it's not easy to drill. So much force and the eggs will shattered.

Kitchenwell Multi-Purpose Trolley Storage Organizer and Kitchen Accessories Items for Kitchen Storage Rack Square Design Fruits & Vegetable Onion Cutlery (Matt Black, 3 Layer Drawer),5.0 out of 5 stars,It's easy to assemble, storage wise one box holds almost 5 kg of onion,
Paint is okay okay
Base isn't even so it won't stay firm goes off balance one side ( manageable, still could be better)
While wheels being fixed on it works fine
Looks classy in kitchen like an upgrade and vegetables won't be messy looking from out it's all stored inside making kitchen bit cleaner

Overall would recommend it
